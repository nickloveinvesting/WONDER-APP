## TWITTER THREAD BEST PRACTICES

### DO:

- Use line breaks for readability
- Include visuals (screenshots, GIFs)
- End with clear CTA
- Number your tweets (1/12 format)
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Reply to every comment quickly

## THREAD VARIATION 1: Problem-Focused Hook

### Tweet 1/12 (Hook - Problem):
```
I spent years having philosophical discussions on Reddit and Twitter.

Every single one followed the same pattern:

Person with more followers or better one-liner "wins" — even when their reasoning is terrible.

So I built something to fix that.
```

### Tweet 2/12 (Problem expansion):
```
The problem with online philosophy:

❌ Twitter: Hot takes beat thoughtful arguments
❌ Reddit: Upvotes favor what sounds good, not what's logically sound
❌ Academic forums: Gatekeeping + terrible UX
❌ Debate platforms: Too competitive, gaming the system

Quality reasoning never wins.
```

### Tweet 3/12 (Personal story):
```
Last year I wrote a careful, well-researched argument about free will on a philosophy subreddit.

It got 3 upvotes.

A snarky one-liner posted 2 hours later got 847.

That's when I knew we needed a different system.
```
**[Visual: Screenshot of Reddit showing upvote disparity]**

### Tweet 4/12 (The insight):
```
The insight:

What if arguments were judged on actual merit—logic, evidence, rhetoric—not popularity?

What if a well-reasoned argument from a beginner could beat a weak argument from an expert?

What if we rewarded quality thinking instead of follower count?
```

### Tweet 5/12 (Solution intro):
```
Introducing ARGUED.

A platform where philosophical debates are judged by AI on:

🧠 Logic: Is the reasoning sound?
📊 Evidence: Are claims supported?
✍️ Rhetoric: Is it clear and persuasive?

Your argument. Their argument. Fairly judged.
```
**[Visual: Screenshot of ARGUED homepage]**

### Tweet 6/12 (How it works):
```
How it works:

1️⃣ Pick a philosophical topic (or create your own)
2️⃣ Join a debate as FOR or AGAINST
3️⃣ Submit your best argument
4️⃣ AI judges both arguments independently
5️⃣ Get detailed feedback + scores
6️⃣ Win reputation points for quality reasoning
```
**[Visual: GIF showing debate flow]**

### Tweet 7/12 (The AI piece):
```
The AI isn't just scoring—it's teaching.

Every judgment includes:
• Detailed written feedback
• Scores for logic, evidence, rhetoric
• Identification of fallacies
• Suggestions for improvement

You learn whether you win or lose.
```
**[Visual: Screenshot of AI judgment with feedback]**

### Tweet 8/12 (Fairness):
```
"But can AI be fair?"

Great question. Our approach:

✅ Three separate scores (reduces bias)
✅ Detailed reasoning (transparent judgment)
✅ Consistent scoring (tested across 50+ debates)
✅ Human appeals (coming soon)

It's not perfect, but it's fairer than upvotes.
```

### Tweet 9/12 (Who it's for):
```
ARGUED is for:

• Philosophy students practicing arguments
• Curious learners exploring big questions
• Debate enthusiasts wanting fair competition
• Anyone tired of Twitter philosophy
• Academics looking for accessible discourse

Beginner to expert—all levels welcome.
```

### Tweet 10/12 (Current stage):
```
We're in early beta.

What works:
✅ Debate creation & joining
✅ AI judgment (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
✅ Reputation system
✅ Topic discovery

What's coming:
🔜 Multi-round debates
🔜 Reading groups
🔜 Socratic dialogue mode
🔜 Study partners
```

### Tweet 11/12 (Invitation):
```
I'm looking for early users to:

• Try a debate and tell me if the AI is fair
• Suggest topics you'd like to debate
• Break the system (seriously, try to game it)
• Share what would make philosophical discourse better

Your feedback shapes this.
```

### Tweet 12/12 (CTA):
```
Try ARGUED:

Or just reply and tell me:

What's your biggest frustration with philosophical discussions online?

Building this in public. Follow along. 🧠✨

## THREAD VARIATION 2: Curiosity-Driven Hook

### Tweet 1/10 (Hook - Curiosity):
```
What if I told you an AI could fairly judge philosophical debates?

I was skeptical too.

Then I built it and tested it on 50+ debates.

The results surprised me. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2/10 (Setup the challenge):
```
The challenge:

Can AI distinguish between:
• Sound reasoning vs. fallacies
• Supported claims vs. baseless assertions
• Clear arguments vs. confusing rhetoric

Without being biased toward certain philosophical positions?

I had to find out.
```

### Tweet 3/10 (The experiment):
```
I built ARGUED—a platform where Gemini AI judges philosophical debates.

Each argument gets scored on:
• Logic (0-10)
• Evidence (0-10)
• Rhetoric (0-10)

Plus detailed written feedback explaining every score.

Here's what I learned...
```
**[Visual: Screenshot of scoring interface]**

### Tweet 4/10 (Surprising finding #1):
```
Finding #1: AI catches fallacies humans miss

In 50+ debates, the AI identified:
• Ad hominem attacks
• Strawman arguments
• False dichotomies
• Circular reasoning

Even when they were subtle. Even when humans upvoted them.

It's shockingly good at this.
```

### Tweet 5/10 (Surprising finding #2):
```
Finding #2: AI rewards clarity over complexity

The highest-scoring arguments weren't the ones with fancy vocabulary.

They were the ones with:
✅ Clear structure
✅ Logical flow
✅ Supported claims
✅ Acknowledged counterarguments

Substance > style.
```

### Tweet 6/10 (Surprising finding #3):
```
Finding #3: AI is consistent

We re-judged the same arguments multiple times.

Scores varied by only 1-2 points.

Compare that to Reddit where timing, subreddit, and mood determine everything.

Consistency matters for fairness.
```

### Tweet 7/10 (The bigger vision):
```
But here's the real vision:

A platform where quality reasoning beats popularity.

Where a beginner with a strong argument can beat an expert with a weak one.

Where you get feedback that makes you a better thinker.

That's what we're building.
```
**[Visual: Screenshot showing community/platform]**

### Tweet 8/10 (How you can try it):
```
You can try it now:

1. Go to [your-url-here]
2. Pick a philosophical topic
3. Submit your best argument
4. Get AI judgment + detailed feedback

It's free. It's in beta. It's ready for your critique.
```

### Tweet 9/10 (Honest ask):
```
I need your help:

Try a debate. Tell me if the AI judgment feels fair.

If it's wrong, I want to know exactly why.

If it's right, tell me what made it fair.

Your feedback is how we improve this.
```

### Tweet 10/10 (CTA):
```
Try ARGUED: [your-url-here]

Reply with the topic you'd most want to debate.

I'm reading every response.

Let's build better discourse together. 🧠

## THREAD VARIATION 3: Story-Driven Hook

### Tweet 1/11 (Hook - Story):
```
A philosophy professor once told me:

"The problem with online philosophy isn't the ideas—it's the incentives."

Three years later, I finally understood what he meant.

And I built ARGUED to fix it. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2/11 (The realization):
```
Here's what he meant:

Every platform rewards the wrong things:

📱 Twitter: Viral hot takes
⬆️ Reddit: Early comments that sound good
📚 Academia: Credentials and gatekeeping
🏆 Debate sites: Winning at all costs

None reward *good reasoning*.
```

### Tweet 3/11 (Personal frustration):
```
I felt this personally.

I'd spend an hour crafting a thoughtful argument:
• Research evidence
• Structure logic carefully
• Acknowledge counterarguments
• Cite sources

Then watch a snarky reply get 10x more engagement.

The incentives are broken.
```

### Tweet 4/11 (The question):
```
So I asked:

"What would a platform look like if it rewarded quality reasoning instead of virality?"

The answer became ARGUED:

Where AI judges arguments on logic, evidence, and rhetoric.

Not followers. Not upvotes. Not timing.

Just reasoning quality.
```

### Tweet 5/11 (The build):
```
Building this was harder than I expected.

Questions I had to solve:

• How do you make AI judgment feel fair?
• How do you prevent gaming the system?
• How do you make philosophy accessible, not intimidating?
• How do you build community, not just competition?
```

### Tweet 6/11 (The breakthrough):
```
The breakthrough:

Separate judgment into three dimensions:

🧠 Logic: Sound reasoning, avoiding fallacies
📊 Evidence: Supporting claims with facts
✍️ Rhetoric: Clarity and persuasiveness

Then give detailed written feedback for each.

Transparency builds trust.
```
**[Visual: Screenshot of three-score system]**

### Tweet 7/11 (How it works):
```
Here's the flow:

You: Submit argument for a philosophical topic
Opponent: Submits their counter-argument
AI: Judges both independently on logic/evidence/rhetoric
Both: Get detailed feedback and scores
Winner: Earns reputation points

Takes ~10 min. Learn whether you win or lose.
```
**[Visual: GIF of debate process]**

### Tweet 8/11 (What makes it different):
```
What makes ARGUED different:

❌ Not just a debate platform (it's a learning tool)
❌ Not just AI judgment (it's detailed feedback)
❌ Not just for experts (beginners welcome)
❌ Not optimized for virality (optimized for reasoning)

It's what I wish existed 3 years ago.
```

### Tweet 9/11 (Current state):
```
We're in early beta.

50+ debates tested.
AI judgment is surprisingly good.
Users report it feels fair and useful.

But we need more perspectives.

More debates, more edge cases, more feedback.

That's where you come in.
```

### Tweet 10/11 (The invitation):
```
I'm inviting you to:

1. Try a debate on ARGUED
2. Test if the AI judgment feels fair
3. Tell me what's missing
4. Suggest topics you'd want to debate

Early users shape this platform.

Be one of them.
```

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### Reply to Comments Within 5 Minutes:
```
[User]: "How do you prevent bias in AI judgment?"

You: "Great question! We use three separate scores (logic, evidence, rhetoric) and provide detailed written reasoning. This makes bias more visible and easier to catch. We've tested ~50 debates and consistency is strong, but we're adding human appeals soon too. What specific biases concern you most?"
```

### Ask Follow-Up Questions:
```
[User]: "This is cool!"

You: "Thanks! What philosophical topics would you want to debate? Trying to understand what our early users care about most."
```

### Acknowledge Criticism:
