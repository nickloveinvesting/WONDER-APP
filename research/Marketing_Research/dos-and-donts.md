## The Golden Rules

### ✅ DO

1. **Provide Value First**
   - Answer questions in the community before promoting
   - Share insights from your research/development
   - Contribute to discussions genuinely
   - Build comment karma in target subreddits

2. **Be Transparently You**
   - "I'm the creator" upfront
   - Admit limitations and early stage
   - Share your genuine frustrations that led to building this
   - Use first person, not corporate "we"

3. **Invite Criticism**
   - "Roast my approach"
   - "What am I missing?"
   - "Tell me why this won't work"
   - "What should I change?"

4. **Lead with Problems, Not Solutions**
   - Start with pain points everyone feels
   - Make it relatable before mentioning your platform
   - "Have you noticed [problem]?" > "I built [solution]"

5. **Adapt to Each Community**
   - Read last 20 top posts before posting
   - Match tone, length, style
   - Reference community-specific discussions
   - Use community language/memes when appropriate

2. **Spam Behaviors**
   - ❌ Post same content to 10 subreddits in one day
   - ❌ Copy-paste identical posts
   - ❌ Only comment with your link
   - ❌ Use alt accounts to upvote/comment
   - ❌ DM people who didn't ask

3. **Overpromising**
   - ❌ "This will solve all problems with online discourse"
   - ❌ "Better than [established platform]"
   - ❌ Features you haven't built yet
   - ❌ "Launching soon" when you're months away

4. **Being Defensive**
   - ❌ Arguing with criticism
   - ❌ Explaining why critics are wrong
   - ❌ Making excuses for limitations
   - ❌ Getting into extended debates

5. **Ignoring Community Norms**
   - ❌ Posting without reading rules
   - ❌ Self-promoting in "no promotion" subs
   - ❌ Not participating in your own post's discussion
   - ❌ Abandoning post after initial replies

## What Gets Upvoted on Reddit

### Format Elements That Work

✅ **Problem-First Opening**
```
Good: "I've been trying to discuss philosophy on Reddit for years.
Every serious question gets buried under memes and bad-faith arguments..."

Bad: "Introducing ARGUED - the revolutionary philosophy platform!"
```

✅ **Personal Story**
```
Good: "Last year I posted a question about Kant's categorical imperative.
Got 3 meme responses and one 'read the book' dismissal. That's when I
realized..."

Bad: "Our team identified a gap in the philosophy discussion market..."
```

✅ **Vulnerability**
```
Good: "I don't know if this will work. It's rough, probably has bugs,
and might be solving a problem that doesn't exist. But I had to try..."

Bad: "After extensive market research, we've developed the optimal
solution..."
```

✅ **Specific Examples**
```
Good: "For example, you could start a reading group for Meditations,
discuss one book per week, with structured commentary on specific passages..."

Bad: "Enable rich philosophical discussions across multiple formats..."
```

✅ **Self-Aware Humor**
```
Good: "I spent 3 months building a platform to escape Reddit philosophy
discussions. Now I'm on Reddit promoting it. The irony is not lost on me."

Bad: [Taking yourself too seriously]
```

✅ **Asking Genuine Questions**
```
Good: "What would make you actually use this? What am I missing?
What would need to change?"

Bad: "Check it out and let me know what you think!"
```

## What Gets Downvoted on Reddit

### Red Flags That Trigger Downvotes

❌ **Vague Marketing Claims**
```
Bad: "Revolutionary AI-powered platform for next-generation philosophical
discourse that disrupts traditional discussion paradigms..."

Why: Meaningless buzzwords, no substance
```

❌ **Walls of Text Without Formatting**
```
Bad: [500 words, no paragraph breaks, no bullet points, no bold/italic]

Why: Hard to read, looks like spam
```

❌ **All Features, No Use Cases**
```
Bad: "Features: Discussion threads, user profiles, upvoting, tagging,
search, notifications, DMs, groups..."

Why: Sounds like every platform ever, no unique value clear
```

❌ **Asking for Signups Before Providing Value**
```
Bad: "Sign up now at [link]! Limited beta spots available!"

Why: Feels transactional, pushy
```

❌ **Not Engaging in Comments**
```
Bad: [Post goes up, OP never responds to questions/comments]

Why: Looks like spam bot, not genuine person
```

❌ **Defensive Responses to Criticism**
```
Bad: "Actually, if you read my post carefully, you'd see that I addressed
this. The problem is that people don't understand..."

Why: Condescending, shows you're not open to feedback
```

❌ **"Giving Away" Free Access Like It's Valuable**
```
Bad: "First 100 signups get FREE premium access! ($99 value!)"

Why: It's beta, it's supposed to be free, feels manipulative
```

## Timing Best Practices

### Best Times to Post (EST)

**Weekday mornings (8-11 AM)**:
- ✅ Good for r/philosophy, r/askphilosophy
- ✅ Catches morning Reddit browsers
- ✅ Full day for discussion to develop
- ❌ High competition for attention

**Weekday afternoons (1-3 PM)**:
- ✅ Good for r/SideProject, r/AlphaandBetausers
- ✅ Post-lunch Reddit browsing
- ✅ Tech workers taking breaks
- ❌ Less time before evening drop-off

**Sunday evenings (7-9 PM)**:
- ✅ Great for most subreddits
- ✅ Catches Monday morning traffic
- ✅ People planning their week
- ❌ Slower initial engagement

**Tuesday/Wednesday (general)**:
- ✅ Best days overall
- ✅ Mid-week engagement peak
- ✅ Not competing with weekend content

### Worst Times to Post

❌ **Friday afternoon/evening**: Weekend mode, less serious engagement
❌ **Saturday**: Low traffic on philosophy subs
❌ **Monday morning**: People catching up, high competition
❌ **Late night (after 10 PM EST)**: Traffic drops significantly
❌ **During major news events**: No one paying attention

### Spacing Your Posts

**Same subreddit**:
- Wait minimum 1 week between posts
- 2-3 weeks is better
- Different angle/format each time

**Different subreddits**:
- Don't post to 5 subreddits same day (looks like spam)
- Max 2-3 related subreddits per day
- Space throughout week

**Cross-posting**:
- ❌ Don't use Reddit's crosspost feature for promotion

### Building Discussion Momentum

**Good engagement triggers more engagement**:

## The Ultimate Reddit Mindset

**Think like a community member, not a marketer.**

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- Would I upvote this if someone else posted it?
- Am I adding value or just promoting?
- Am I genuinely curious about feedback?
- Would I engage with this post?
- Am I being authentic?

**If answers are yes** → Post it
**If answers are no** → Revise or skip

---

**Remember**: Reddit can smell marketing from a mile away. The only sustainable approach is genuine participation, adding value, and sharing your project as one small part of that value contribution.

**Best promotional posts don't feel promotional. They feel like valuable insights from a fellow community member who happens to be building something interesting.**
