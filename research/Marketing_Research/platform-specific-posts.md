### FACEBOOK POST VARIATION 1: Personal Story

**Title/Opening:**
```
I built something for philosophy lovers who are tired of Twitter arguments 🧠
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been part of this group for a while (mostly lurking, occasionally commenting on debates about free will 😄), and I wanted to share something I've been working on.

**The frustration:**

I love having philosophical discussions online, but it always ends the same way—whoever has more followers or posts the snarkiest reply "wins," even if their reasoning is weak.

Last year, I spent an hour writing a thoughtful argument about moral realism on Reddit. It got 3 upvotes. A one-liner posted later got 800+. That's when I knew something was broken.

**What I built:**

ARGUED is a platform where philosophical debates are judged by AI on actual reasoning quality—logic, evidence, and rhetoric—instead of popularity.

Here's how it works:
• Pick a philosophical topic (or create one)
• Submit your argument FOR or AGAINST
• AI judges both arguments fairly
• Get detailed feedback to improve your reasoning
• Earn reputation for quality thinking

**Why I think you'll like it:**

✅ Beginner-friendly (you don't need a PhD to participate)
✅ Fair judgment (your argument stands on its own merit)
✅ Learn something (detailed feedback on your reasoning)
✅ No trolls (structured debates, respectful environment)
✅ Actually fun (there's something satisfying about crafting a good argument)

**Try it if you're curious:** [link]

**I'd love your feedback:**
• Does the AI judgment feel fair?
• What topics would you want to debate?
• What features would make this useful for you?

Still early beta, still learning, still improving. Built this because I wanted it to exist—hoping some of you find it useful too.

Let me know what you think! 🙏

P.S. If you try it, tell me how it goes. I'm responding to every message!

### FACEBOOK POST VARIATION 2: Community-Focused

**Title/Opening:**
```
Question: Where do you go for serious philosophical discussions online?
```

**Body:**
```
Genuine question for this group:

Where do you have the best philosophical conversations online?

I've tried:
- Twitter (too fast, too shallow)
- Reddit (good content gets buried)
- Philosophy forums (often inactive)
- Academic spaces (gatekeeping)

None of them felt quite right. So I built something different.

**Introducing ARGUED:**

A platform designed specifically for philosophical discourse where:

🧠 Arguments are judged on reasoning quality, not upvotes
📊 You get detailed feedback on your logic, evidence, and rhetoric
🏆 Beginners and experts can compete fairly
🤝 Community shapes the platform (we're building this together)

**What makes it different:**

Instead of hoping your comment gets upvoted, you submit a structured argument and get AI feedback on:
• Is your logic sound?
• Are your claims supported?
• Is your argument clear and persuasive?

Win or lose, you learn something.

**Current topics people are debating:**
- Is free will an illusion?
- Should we value happiness over meaning?
- Can AI be conscious?
- Is moral realism true?
- Does God exist?

**I'm looking for early users who:**
- Love philosophical discussion
- Want to improve their reasoning
- Are willing to give honest feedback
- Want to shape what this becomes

**Try it:** [link]

This is very much a work in progress. I'm building it in public and listening to every piece of feedback.

What would make a philosophy platform useful for YOU?

Drop a comment or DM me—I'm reading everything. 🙏

### FACEBOOK POST VARIATION 3: Value-Driven

**Title/Opening:**
```
Philosophy should be accessible, not intimidating 🌟
```

**Body:**
```
Hot take: Philosophy belongs to everyone, not just academics.

You don't need a PhD to think deeply about big questions. You don't need perfect reasoning to get started. You just need curiosity and a willingness to learn.

But most online spaces make philosophy feel gatekeepy or chaotic. Either you're in formal academia (which is expensive and exclusive) or you're on Twitter where nuance goes to die.

**That's why I built ARGUED.**

It's a platform where anyone—from curious beginners to seasoned philosophers—can have structured, fair philosophical debates.

**Here's what makes it different:**

🌱 **Beginner-Friendly:** You don't need fancy vocabulary. Just submit your best reasoning.

⚖️ **Actually Fair:** AI judges arguments on logic, evidence, and rhetoric—not follower count or posting time.

📚 **You Learn:** Every judgment includes detailed feedback. Win or lose, you get better at reasoning.

🎯 **Low Pressure:** It's not about "winning" a Twitter fight. It's about testing ideas and improving thinking.

🤝 **Community-Driven:** All levels welcome. Respectful discourse. No trolling.

**Try debating a topic you care about:**

Go to [link], pick a philosophical question that interests you, and submit your argument. The AI will give you honest feedback.

It takes 10 minutes. It's free. And you might learn something about how you reason.

**What topics are you curious about?**

Drop them in the comments—if there's demand, I'll add them to the platform!

Building this for people like you. Would love to hear what you think. 💙

### INDIE HACKERS COMPLETE POST

**Title:** Built an AI-judged philosophical debate platform (ARGUED) - Here's what I learned

**Body:**
```
Hey IH,

I just launched ARGUED—a platform where AI judges philosophical debates on reasoning quality instead of popularity. Wanted to share the journey and get feedback from other makers.

**The Problem I'm Solving:**

I'm a philosophy enthusiast who got frustrated with online discussions. Reddit upvotes reward timing and snark over reasoning. Twitter rewards hot takes. Academic spaces are gatekeeping. There's no good middle ground for serious but accessible philosophical discourse.

So I built it.

**Tech Stack & Why:**

• **Next.js 15 (App Router):** Fast, great DX, excellent for AI integration
• **Supabase:** All-in-one (auth, database, real-time) for solo dev
• **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Cheap (~$0.00001/judgment), fast, good reasoning capabilities
• **TypeScript:** Type safety saves hours of debugging
• **Vercel:** Deploy in seconds, scales automatically

**Why these choices:**

- Solo founder = need to move fast
- Budget = $0 (bootstrapped)
- Supabase free tier + Gemini API = can support 1000s of users for $20/month
- Wanted to focus on product, not infrastructure

**The Build:**

Took ~3 months of nights and weekends.

Hardest parts:
1. **AI consistency:** Getting Gemini to judge fairly required tons of prompt engineering. Settled on scoring three dimensions separately (logic, evidence, rhetoric) then aggregating.

2. **Preventing gaming:** How do you stop people from finding "magic phrases" that score high? Still working on this—considering multiple AI models for cross-validation.

3. **Making philosophy accessible:** The UI had to not be intimidating. Lots of iteration on copy, onboarding, examples.

**Launch Strategy:**

Planning to post on:
- Product Hunt (next Tuesday)
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Philosophy forums (carefully, respectfully)
- Twitter (building in public)
- Here (you're seeing it first!)

**Current Status:**

• 50+ test debates run
• Core features working (debate creation, AI judgment, reputation)
• No users yet (soft launch)
- $0 revenue (figuring out monetization later)
• Solo founder (me)

**Early Metrics I'm Tracking:**

- Signups
- Debates created (activation)
- Debates completed (engagement)
- Return rate (retention)
- AI judgment fairness feedback (qualitative)

**What I Need Help With:**

1. **Monetization ideas:** What would people pay for in a debate platform? Premium features? Ad-free? Advanced AI feedback?

2. **Growth strategy:** Best channels for reaching philosophy enthusiasts? Education market?

3. **Technical scaling:** At what point do I need to move beyond Supabase free tier? What breaks first?

4. **AI fairness:** How do I make automated judgment feel legitimate and trustworthy?

**Lessons Learned So Far:**

✅ **Ship fast:** I could have spent 6 more months adding features. Better to get it in front of users.

✅ **Prompt engineering is hard:** Spent as much time on AI prompts as on code. It's a skill worth developing.

✅ **Pick boring tech:** Next.js + Supabase let me focus on the unique part (AI judgment), not reinvent auth or databases.

❌ **Unclear ICP:** I built for "me" but haven't validated if others have this problem. Probably should have talked to more users first.

❌ **Scope creep:** Cut 10 features from the MVP. Still probably built too much.

**Metrics After 1 Week (I'll update):**

- Signups: [will update]
- Debates created: [will update]
- Feedback themes: [will update]

**Questions for IH:**

- Would you use this? Why or why not?

### LINKEDIN POST VARIATION 1: Problem-Solution

**Post:**
```
The quality of online philosophical discourse has been bothering me for years.

Twitter rewards hot takes over thoughtful reasoning. Reddit upvotes favor timing over logic. Academic spaces are inaccessible to most people.

So I built ARGUED—a platform where philosophical debates are judged by AI on actual merit:

🧠 Logic: Sound reasoning, avoiding fallacies
📊 Evidence: Supported claims
✍️ Rhetoric: Clear, persuasive presentation

Every argument gets detailed feedback, not just a score. Beginners can compete fairly with experts. Quality thinking is rewarded.

We're in early beta with core features working. The AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) consistently identifies fallacies, rewards structured reasoning, and provides substantive feedback.

**Why this matters for education:**

Students practicing argumentation get immediate, detailed feedback. Educators can assign structured debates. Learners improve critical thinking skills.

Philosophy should be accessible, not gatekeeping.

**Try it:** [link]

Looking for early adopters, educators interested in critical thinking tools, and anyone tired of Twitter philosophy.

Feedback welcome. Building in public.
