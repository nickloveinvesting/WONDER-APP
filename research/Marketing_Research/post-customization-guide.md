# Post Customization Guide for Reddit Promotion

This guide helps you adapt the template posts to each specific community, moment, and context.

---

## General Customization Principles

### 1. Community Research Before Posting
**Do this EVERY time before posting**:
- Read the last 10-20 top posts in the subreddit
- Note the tone, length, and style that gets upvotes
- Check if self-promotion is allowed (read rules AND check recent posts)
- Look at successful promotional posts in that community
- Note what gets downvoted or removed

### 2. Timing Your Posts to Current Discussions

**Search for recent relevant threads**:
```
Before posting to r/philosophy:
- Search "online philosophy discussion" in last month
- Find highly-engaged threads about similar topics
- Reference these in your post: "Saw the recent thread about X..."
- Shows you're part of the community, not just promoting
```

**Example customization**:
```
Original: "Philosophy discussions online are broken."

Customized: "Following up on last week's discussion about the decline
of quality in r/philosophy, I wanted to share something I've been working on..."
```

### 3. Seasonal/Event-Based Customization

**Academic calendar**:
- **September**: "Starting the semester? Looking for discussion partners?"
- **December/May**: "Semester ending? Keep the discussions going..."
- **Summer**: "Summer reading projects - work through texts together"

**Philosophy events**:
- **Stoic Week**: Post to r/Stoicism about Stoic practice features
- **Philosophy conference season**: Reference accessibility vs. gatekeeping
- **Book releases**: "Reading the new [philosopher] book? Let's discuss..."

**Current events with philosophical implications**:
- **AI news**: Emphasize AI ethics features
- **Political events**: Focus on political philosophy discussions
- **Social issues**: Highlight moral philosophy and ethics features

## Subreddit-Specific Customization

### r/philosophy

**Community characteristics**:
- High standards for quality
- Academic-leaning but not exclusively
- Skeptical of self-promotion
- Values meta-discussion about philosophy itself

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Lead with philosophical problem, not product**:
   ```
   Bad: "I built a philosophy platform!"
   Good: "The digital public sphere has failed philosophical discourse. Here's why..."
   ```

2. **Reference philosophical concepts**:
   ```
   "Habermas wrote about the ideal speech situation. Online platforms
   seem designed to prevent exactly that. I've been thinking about what
   structural features might support rational discourse..."
   ```

3. **Cite recent r/philosophy discussions**:
   ```
   "In response to u/[username]'s point in the recent thread about
   online discourse, I wanted to share an experiment..."
   ```

4. **Acknowledge limitations**:
   ```
   "This doesn't solve all the problems with online philosophy. But it's
   an attempt to address [specific issue]."
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Increase intellectual rigor in opening
- Add references to philosophers or concepts
- Tone down promotional language
- Increase reflection on "why this matters philosophically"

---

### r/askphilosophy

**Community characteristics**:
- Very strict rules (read carefully!)
- Focused on helping people learn
- Academic standards
- Self-promotion usually not welcome

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Frame as genuine question**:
   ```
   "Where do graduate students and independent scholars have sustained
   philosophical discussions online these days? I'm trying to understand
   the landscape..."
   ```

2. **Minimal self-promotion**:
   ```
   Add only in edit or comment: "Update: Many asked about the platform
   I mentioned. Here's more info..."
   ```

3. **Provide value first**:
   ```
   Answer someone else's question thoughtfully
   Build comment history in the community
   Then post your question
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Remove ALL direct promotion from initial post
- Frame entirely as question
- Only mention your project if directly asked
- Consider commenting on other posts first to build rapport

---

### r/SideProject

**Community characteristics**:
- Builders sharing with builders
- Welcomes self-promotion
- Values technical details
- Wants to see the journey

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Add technical specifics**:
   ```
   "Built with Next.js 14, using Server Components for the reading group
   features. Integrated Claude API for Socratic questioning. Biggest
   challenge: managing conversation state across different formats..."
   ```

2. **Share metrics**:
   ```
   "Current status:
   - 3 months development
   - ~50 beta users
   - 200+ philosophical discussions
   - Retention: 60% week-over-week (small sample)
   - Biggest drop-off: onboarding (working on it)"
   ```

3. **Discuss trade-offs**:
   ```
   "I chose persistent discussions over real-time chat. Trade-off: less
   immediate engagement, but deeper conversations. Still learning if this
   was the right call..."
   ```

4. **Ask builder-specific questions**:
   ```
   "Fellow builders: How do you balance structure vs. freedom in
   conversation platforms? Every feature I add risks making it feel
   constrained..."
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Add tech stack details
- Include development timeline
- Share specific challenges
- Mention what you're learning
- Ask for technical/design feedback

---

### r/Stoicism

**Community characteristics**:
- Practical focus (not just academic)
- Mix of beginners and experienced practitioners
- Values authenticity and lived practice
- Supportive, less skeptical than r/philosophy

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Tie to Stoic practice**:
   ```
   "The Stoics emphasized learning through dialogue (Epictetus and his
   students, Marcus writing to himself). Modern platforms seem designed
   for performance, not practice. Here's what I'm trying..."
   ```

2. **Offer concrete Stoic features**:
   ```
   "Features specifically for Stoic practice:
   - Weekly Meditations reading group
   - Premeditatio malorum scenarios
   - Dichotomy of control discussions
   - Evening reflection circles"
   ```

3. **Reference specific Stoic texts**:
   ```
   "Starting with Book 1 of Meditations next Monday. Using the
   Gregory Hays translation. Week-by-week discussion format..."
   ```

4. **Acknowledge your own practice**:
   ```
   "I've practiced Stoicism for 3 years. This platform grew from my own
   frustration trying to find discussion partners for working through the
   Discourses..."
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Emphasize practical application
- Reference specific Stoic texts/concepts
- Show your own Stoic practice
- Focus on community benefit over tech features

---

### r/existentialism

**Community characteristics**:
- Values authenticity and genuine struggle
- Skeptical of commercialization
- Mix of academic and personal exploration
- Appreciates self-aware irony

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Address the irony**:
   ```
   "There's something deeply inauthentic about promoting a platform for
   authentic philosophical discourse. I'm aware of the contradiction..."
   ```

2. **Personal struggle over product features**:
   ```
   "I built this because I felt alienated trying to discuss Camus on
   platforms optimized for engagement metrics. Maybe that's creating
   another alienating system. I don't know..."
   ```

3. **Reference existentialist concepts directly**:
   ```
   "Sartre wrote about bad faith. Social media platforms seem designed
   to encourage it - performing authenticity rather than living it. Can
   a platform avoid this? Or is that naive?"
   ```

4. **Vulnerability over confidence**:
   ```
   "I'm not sure this solves anything. But I needed to try. The absurd
   hero and all that..."
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Increase vulnerability and uncertainty
- Add existentialist references
- Acknowledge contradictions and limitations
- Self-aware tone about platform-building itself

---

### r/changemyview

**Community characteristics**:
- Very specific format and rules
- Values good-faith discourse
- Sophisticated about argumentation
- Protective of their community culture

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Deep respect for CMV**:
   ```
   "CMV has taught me more about productive disagreement than any
   philosophy class. I'm not trying to replace what you've built here..."
   ```

2. **Clear differentiation**:
   ```
   "CMV is perfect for 'I believe X, change my view'
   This is for 'I'm genuinely confused about X, help me explore'
   Different needs, different formats."
   ```

3. **Reference CMV mechanics**:
   ```
   "I love how CMV's delta system incentivizes good-faith engagement.
   I'm thinking about what incentive structures support collaborative
   exploration rather than persuasion..."
   ```

4. **Ask for CMV community input**:
   ```
   "You're experts at productive discourse. What would make a
   'collaborative exploration' format actually work?"
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Emphasize complement, not replacement
- Show deep understanding of CMV's value
- Ask for their expertise
- Be humble about your alternative approach

### r/AlphaandBetausers

**Community characteristics**:
- Transactional (beta access for feedback)
- Values clear asks and time commitments
- Wants to know what's in it for them
- Appreciates honesty about stage

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Crystal clear asks**:
   ```
   "What I need:
   - 20 users
   - 2-3 hours/week for 2 weeks
   - Participate in 5+ discussions
   - Complete 2 feedback surveys
   - Optional 30-min interview"
   ```

   ```
   "What you get:

   - Direct product influence
   - Listed as founding beta tester
   - Early access to all features"
   ```

3. **What you're testing**:
   ```
   "Specific questions:
   1. Do structured formats beat free-form?
   2. Is AI facilitation helpful or annoying?
   3. Can we onboard users in <5 minutes?
   4. What's minimum viable moderation?"
   ```

4. **Application process**:
   ```
   "To apply:
   1. Fill out form [link]
   2. I'll select 20 users by Friday
   3. Onboarding email Monday
   4. Testing starts Wednesday"
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Make all asks explicit
- Clarify time commitments
- List specific benefits
- Show selection/application process

---

### r/PhilosophyMemes

**Community characteristics**:
- Humor-first, but often philosophically literate
- Self-aware about philosophy culture
- Appreciates irony and meta-commentary
- Actually receptive to serious content if framed right

**Customization strategies**:

1. **Lean into meme format**:
   ```
   "Nobody:
   Absolutely nobody:
   Me: What if I built a whole platform to avoid 'Is water wet?' debates
   Also me: Let me promote it on Reddit Philosophy"
   ```

2. **Self-deprecating humor**:
   ```
   "I spent 3 months building a philosophy platform. Named it ARGUED.
   Marketing genius or nominative determinism? You decide."
   ```

3. **Reference popular philosophy memes**:
   ```
   "You: Upvoting Diogenes memes
   Me: Actually wanting to discuss Cynicism
   We are not the same (but we could be on this platform)"
   ```

4. **But still provide real info**:
   ```
   "Joking aside, here's what it actually is: [2-3 sentences]
   If interested: [link]
   If not: Enjoy the memes, kings 👑"
   ```

**What to adjust**:
- Add humor and self-awareness
- Use meme formats/references
- Keep it light but include real info
- Don't take yourself too seriously

## Personalization Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Local Reference
**Search for recent discussions in target subreddit**:
```
1. Use Reddit search: "[subreddit] online discussion" (past month)
2. Find top post related to your topic
3. Reference it in opening:

"Following up on u/[username]'s excellent point in [post title] about
the challenge of sustained philosophical discourse online..."
```

**Why it works**: Shows you're part of community, not just dropping promotional content.

---

### Strategy 2: The Seasonal Hook
**Adapt to time of year**:

**September (Academic year starting)**:
```
"Starting a new semester of philosophy classes? Looking for discussion
partners outside the classroom? I built a platform for exactly this..."
```

**January (New Year)**:
```
"New Year's resolution: Read more philosophy. Problem: No one to discuss
it with. Solution: [platform]. Let's make 2024 the year of actual
philosophical growth..."
```

**Summer**:
```
"Summer reading project: Work through the Meditations. Join me? I built
a platform for sustained reading groups that don't disappear after a
week..."
```

**Why it works**: Ties your platform to current user intentions and motivations.

---

### Strategy 3: The Response Post
**Don't just post into the void. Respond to existing discussions**:

```
1. Find active discussion about online philosophy communities
2. Engage authentically in comments
3. When someone asks "is there a better option?", respond:

"I actually built something for this exact problem. Still early stage,
but addresses [specific issue they mentioned]. Happy to share more if
interested - don't want to spam the thread."
```

**Why it works**: Contextual, helpful, not spammy. Shows you're listening.

---

### Strategy 4: The Current Event Hook
**When something philosophical happens in the news**:

```
Recent AI developments:
"With all the AI ethics discussions happening, wondering if anyone wants
to actually work through the philosophical arguments together? Built a
platform for exactly this kind of sustained ethical discussion..."

Political events:
"Seeing a lot of political philosophy questions coming up around
[event]. Reddit threads are too chaotic for nuanced discussion. Created
space for working through these ideas more carefully..."
```

**Why it works**: Rides wave of existing interest, positions platform as solution to timely need.

---

### Strategy 5: The Meta Post
**For philosophy communities specifically**:

```
"Meta: How should we even discuss philosophy online?
🤔

Reddit: Great for questions, terrible for sustained dialogue
Twitter: Perfect for hot takes, awful for nuance
Academia: Rigorous but gatekept
Discord: Lively but ephemeral

I tried to design a system that takes the best of each. Here's what I
learned about the structural features that shape philosophical
discourse..."
```

**Why it works**: Philosophy communities love meta-discussion. Lead with fascinating problem, platform is secondary.

## Emergency Customization: When a Post is Flopping

**If post is getting downvoted in first 30 minutes**:

1. **Don't delete immediately** (looks suspicious)
2. **Add clarifying edit**:

   problem. Not trying to spam the community."
   ```
3. **Engage authentically in comments**
4. **If still negative after 2 hours**, consider deleting

1. **Give it time** (4-6 hours)
2. **Cross-post to related but smaller subreddit**
3. **Share in relevant Discord/communities**
4. **Try different time of day next time**

**If post is getting good discussion but few signups**:

1. **This is actually success!**
2. **Engagement > immediate conversions**
3. **Build relationships in comments**
4. **These people may convert later**
5. **Learn from their questions/objections**

## Long-Term Customization Strategy

**Month 1**: Test different approaches
- Post to each subreddit once
- Try different formats/lengths/hooks
- Track what works where

**Month 2**: Double down on what works
- Repeat successful formats
- Improve based on feedback
- Build relationships in top-performing communities

**Month 3**: Thought leadership
- Contribute value without promoting
- Answer questions, share insights
- Become known community member
- Then occasionally mention your project

**Remember**: Best marketing is being genuinely helpful in communities over time. Promotional posts are just the starting point.
