## PHASE 2: Launch Week (Week 0)

### Tuesday (LAUNCH DAY 1) - r/SideProject

**6:00 AM Eastern**:
- Wake up, coffee, final review
- Verify demo link works
- Screenshots ready
- Phone charged, notifications on

**7:00-7:30 AM Eastern** (OPTIMAL POSTING TIME):
- **POST TO r/SideProject**
- Use prepared title (problem-first)
- Include 2-3 screenshots
- Clear call-to-action
- Lead with story, not sales pitch

**Example Post**:
> **Title**: "Reddit buries philosophical discussions after 24 hours - built a platform where they persist and stay searchable. Thoughts?"
>
> **Body**:
> You know that feeling when you have a great philosophical discussion on Reddit or Discord, and then it's just... gone? Buried under new posts or lost in chat history?
>
> I got frustrated with this 6 months ago after a really good debate about free will got 200+ comments on r/philosophy, then disappeared into the void. No way to find it again, no way to continue the conversation a week later.
>
> So I built ARGUED - a platform where philosophical discussions persist, are fully searchable, and can continue for weeks/months. The twist: there's an optional AI facilitator that asks Socratic questions when discussions get stuck (or hit circular logic).
>
> Still super early (launched beta last week), but here's what we have:
> - Persistent discussions (not buried after 24 hours)
> - Full-text search (find that debate from 3 months ago)
> - Reading groups (discuss philosophy books chapter-by-chapter)
> - Optional AI facilitation (asks questions, doesn't judge arguments)
>
> [Screenshot 1: Side-by-side Reddit vs ARGUED]
> [Screenshot 2: AI asking Socratic question]
> [Screenshot 3: Search finding old discussion]
>
> Curious if this actually solves a real problem for anyone here, or if I'm building something nobody wants. Specific feedback I need:
> 1. Is the AI facilitator helpful or annoying?
> 2. UI too academic or approachable enough?
> 3. Would you actually use searchable discussion archives?
>
> Happy to give early access to anyone who wants to try it. Link in comments (didn't want to lead with it).
>
> What am I missing? What would make this actually useful?

>
