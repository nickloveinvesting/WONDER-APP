# Marketing Research for Philosophy Conversation Platform

## Overview
This folder contains comprehensive marketing research for launching a philosophical conversation platform (currently "ARGUED", may rebrand). The research focuses on identifying the best free promotional channels and creating authentic, ready-to-use promotional content.

## Problems Our App Solves

### Pain Points in Existing Spaces
- **Reddit/Twitter**: Philosophy discussions get buried in low-quality comments and trolling
- **Academic journals**: Too formal, gatekeeping, months-long peer review
- **Debate platforms**: Too competitive, focused on winning not learning
- **Social media**: Algorithms reward hot takes, not thoughtful discourse
- **Discord servers**: Conversations disappear, hard to find quality discussions later
- **Philosophy forums**: Outdated UI, sparse activity, fragmented communities
- **General issue**: No good place for "serious but accessible" philosophical conversation

### Our Solutions
- Thoughtful conversation design (not just upvote/downvote chaos)
- Persistent, searchable philosophical discussions
- Optional structure (casual questions OR deep debates)
- AI facilitation (not just judgment)
- Community features (reading groups, study partners, mentorship)
