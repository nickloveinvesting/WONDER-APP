# Response Templates for Reddit Promotional Posts

Quick, authentic responses to common questions, criticisms, and scenarios that arise in Reddit promotional posts.

---

## General Response Principles

1. **Respond quickly**: First 1-2 hours are critical
2. **Be authentic**: No corporate speak, be yourself
3. **Thank criticism**: "Great point" > "Actually..."
4. **Ask questions**: Learn from the community
5. **Don't be defensive**: Acknowledge limitations
6. **Follow up**: Return to conversations that develop

---

## Responding to Interest & Questions

### "This looks interesting! How do I join?"

**Template**:
```
Thanks! I'm excited you're interested. [Link to platform]

Quick heads up - it's very early stage, so expect rough edges. But the
core features (reading groups, Socratic dialogues, etc.) are functional.

Would love to hear your feedback once you try it. What philosophical
topics are you most interested in discussing?
```

**Why it works**: Manages expectations while maintaining enthusiasm.

---

### "What's different about this vs. [existing platform]?"

**Template**:
```
Great question! [Existing platform] is great for [what they do well].
The main differences with ARGUED:

1. [Specific difference 1]
2. [Specific difference 2]
3. [Specific difference 3]

Honestly, they serve different needs. If [existing platform] works for
you, stick with it! I built this for people who specifically want
[unique value proposition].

Have you used [existing platform]? What works/doesn't work for you?
```

**Why it works**: Respectful of competition, specific about differences, asks for their experience.

---

### "Can you explain more about [specific feature]?"

**Template**:
```
Absolutely! [Feature] works like this:

[2-3 sentence explanation with example]

Example: [Concrete scenario showing feature in action]

Current limitations: [Be honest about what's not built yet]

What would make this feature actually useful for you? I'm still
iterating on the design.
```

**Why it works**: Clear explanation, concrete example, invites input.

---

### "When will this be ready/out of beta?"

**Template**:
```
Honestly? I'm not rushing to "launch." I'd rather keep it small and
high-quality while I learn what actually works.

Current plan:
- Beta for next 2-3 months minimum
- Gathering feedback from early users
- Building features based on real needs, not assumptions

I'm more interested in building something genuinely useful than hitting
an arbitrary launch date.

What features would make it "ready" in your mind?
```

**Why it works**: Transparent, shows quality-focus, asks for their criteria.

---

## Responding to Skepticism & Criticism

### "This seems like just another forum/Discord clone"

**Template**:
```
Fair criticism! On the surface it might look similar. The key
differences are [specific structural features].

But you're right to be skeptical - there are a ton of "we're different!"
platforms that aren't actually different.

What would I need to show you to demonstrate this is genuinely solving a
different problem? Happy to walk you through the specific features or
use cases.
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges validity, shows specific differences, asks how to prove it.

---

### "Why do we need another platform? Reddit works fine."

**Template**:
```
Totally valid! Reddit DOES work for a lot of things.

I built this specifically for people who've experienced these limitations:
- [Specific limitation 1 with example]
- [Specific limitation 2 with example]

If you're not hitting those limitations, Reddit is probably the better
choice! Lower friction, bigger community, proven platform.

I'm not trying to replace Reddit. Just offering an alternative for
specific use cases Reddit isn't optimized for.

What works well about Reddit for philosophy discussions in your experience?
```

**Why it works**: Validates Reddit, specific about different use cases, doesn't claim to replace.

---

### "This will just become another toxic/low-quality space"

**Template**:
```
This is my biggest fear, honestly. Quality degradation is real.

Here's how I'm thinking about it:
1. [Specific structural feature to maintain quality]
2. [Moderation approach]
3. [Intentionally limiting growth]

But you're right that I could fail at this. Every platform says "we'll
stay high quality" and most don't.

What structural features do you think actually maintain quality at scale?
I'm genuinely trying to learn from communities that've done this well.
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges fear is valid, shows specific approach, asks for wisdom.

---

### "How will you make money? This will eventually become ad-filled garbage."

**Template**:
```
Great question - sustainability matters.

Current thinking (not committed yet):
- Freemium: Core features free, premium for advanced tools
- No ads ever (kills quality discourse)
- Possible: Pay for advanced AI features
- Possible: Optional supporter tier

I'd rather stay small and sustainable than grow big with ads.

Full transparency: I'm funding this myself currently. Not VC-backed,
no pressure to "scale fast and figure it out later."

What monetization would you be comfortable with for a philosophy platform?
```

**Why it works**: Transparent, shows alignment with quality, not just growth, asks for input.

---

### "AI-facilitated discussions? That sounds terrible."

**Template**:
```
I get the skepticism! AI in philosophy can be really bad.

Important clarifications:
- AI asks questions, never gives answers
- Completely optional - you can ignore it entirely
- Can't participate as a "user", only facilitate
- No "AI judges the winner" nonsense

Example: Human says "Free will is an illusion"
AI might ask: "What would convince you otherwise?"
That's it. Socratic questioning, not lecturing.

But if that still sounds bad, the entire platform works fine without
ever touching the AI features.

What would make AI facilitation actually helpful vs. annoying?
```

**Why it works**: Validates concern, very specific about limitations, emphasizes optional.

---

### "This is just self-promotion/spam"

**Template**:
```
Fair point. I AM promoting something I built.

I tried to make this useful by:
- [How you provided value in the post]
- [Being transparent about stage/limitations]
- [Genuinely asking for feedback]

But if this feels too promotional for this community, I apologize. Not
trying to spam.

What would make this more valuable and less promotional? Genuinely asking.
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges point, shows how you tried to add value, asks for guidance.

---

## Responding to Feature Requests

### "You should add [specific feature]!"

**Template**:
```
Interesting idea! Tell me more about your use case:

- When would you use [feature]?
- What problem does it solve for you?
- How would you want it to work?

I'm keeping a list of requested features. Can't promise I'll build
everything, but I'm definitely listening.

What would this enable that current features don't?
```

**Why it works**: Shows interest, asks clarifying questions, manages expectations.

---

### "Why don't you have [obvious feature]?"

**Template**:
```
Great question! [Feature] is on the roadmap. Didn't include in v1 because:
- [Specific reason - time, complexity, or intentional choice]

Currently prioritizing:
1. [Current priority 1]
2. [Current priority 2]

But if [feature] is critical for you, that's useful feedback. How would
you use it? Helps me understand priority.
```

**Why it works**: Explains decision, shows roadmap, asks about use case.

---

### "This needs [extensive feature list]"

**Template**:
```
You've clearly thought about this! These are all good ideas.

Current focus is on making the core features work really well:
- [Core feature 1]
- [Core feature 2]

I'd rather have 3 excellent features than 20 mediocre ones.

From your list, which 1-2 would make the biggest difference for you?
That helps me prioritize what to build next.
```

**Why it works**: Appreciates input, explains focus, asks them to prioritize.

---

## Responding to Technical Questions

### "What's your tech stack?"

**Template**:
```
Current stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- [Add other relevant tech details]
- AI: Claude API for Socratic facilitation

Happy to discuss technical decisions. What made you curious about the stack?
```

**Why it works**: Direct answer, shows openness to technical discussion.

---

### "Is this open source?"

**Template**:
```
Not currently, but I'm considering it.

Pros: Community contributions, transparency
Cons: Maintaining quality with external contributions, moderation complexity

What would open source enable for you? Curious if it's about:
- Contributing code?
- Self-hosting?
- Transparency/trust?
- Something else?

Helps me think through the decision.
```

**Why it works**: Honest, explains thinking, asks why they care.

---

### "What about privacy/data? Are you selling my data?"

**Template**:
```
Absolutely not selling data. Hard no.

Current approach:
- [Specific privacy measures]
- [Data storage approach]
- [What you track and why]

I can add a detailed privacy page if that would help. What specific
privacy concerns should I address?
```

**Why it works**: Firm stance, specific practices, offers more transparency.

---

## Responding to Philosophical/Meta Questions

### "How do you prevent this from becoming an echo chamber?"

**Template**:
```
This is crucial. Echo chambers kill philosophical discourse.

Current thinking:
1. [Specific feature to encourage diverse perspectives]
2. [Moderation approach that allows disagreement]
3. [Format that requires engaging with counterarguments]

But I could fail at this. It's genuinely hard.

What communities have you seen handle this well? I want to learn from
platforms that successfully maintain intellectual diversity.
```

**Why it works**: Shows you've thought about it, specific measures, asks for examples.

---

### "What makes 'quality' discussion? Who decides?"

**Template**:
```
This is THE philosophical question about the platform itself.

My current thinking:
- Quality = [specific criteria]
- Not about credentials or formal education
- About [values: good faith, curiosity, rigor, etc.]

But you're right that "quality" can become gatekeeping.

How would you define quality philosophical discussion? I'm genuinely
struggling with this balance.
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges difficulty, shows current thinking, asks for their philosophy.

---

### "This seems elitist/gatekeeperish"

**Template**:
```
I really don't want it to be! That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

The challenge: How to welcome beginners AND maintain depth?

Current approach:
- [Specific beginner-friendly features]
- [How you signal all levels welcome]
- [Moderation against gatekeeping]

But if it FEELS elitist, that's a problem I need to fix.

What specifically gave you that impression? And what would make it feel
more welcoming?
```

**Why it works**: Takes concern seriously, shows anti-gatekeeping measures, asks for specifics.

---

## Converting Engagement to Signups

### "Sounds interesting but I'm not ready to sign up yet"

**Template**:
```
Totally fair! It's early and rough.

No pressure, but if you're curious you could:
- Lurk and see what discussions are happening
- Join just one reading group to test it out
- Check back in a month when it's more polished

Or don't! I'm sharing this to get feedback, not maximize signups.

What would make you feel ready to try it?
```

**Why it works**: No pressure, offers low-commitment options, asks what they need.

---

### "I'll wait until it's more developed"

**Template**:
```
Smart! Early stage means bugs and missing features.

I'm keeping a list of people interested in trying it later. Want me to
ping you when [specific milestone]?

Also curious: What does "more developed" mean to you? Helps me understand
what would make it ready.
```

**Why it works**: Respects choice, offers future follow-up, learns their criteria.

---

### Comment shows high interest but doesn't explicitly ask to join

**Template**:
```
You seem like exactly the kind of user I'm looking for! Based on
[specific thing they mentioned], I think you'd find [specific feature]
particularly useful.

Would you be interested in trying it out? Happy to personally onboard
you and hear your feedback.

[Link]
```

**Why it works**: Specific to them, shows you read their comment, personal touch.

---

## Handling Hostility & Bad Faith

### Aggressive/hostile comment

**Template**:
```
I hear that you're frustrated with [what seems to be underlying concern].

If you have specific feedback about why this seems problematic, I'm
genuinely open to hearing it. But if you're just venting, that's okay too.

[Then disengage - don't get drawn into argument]
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges without engaging hostility, offers genuine opening, knows when to stop.

---

### Obvious troll comment

**Template**:
[Don't respond. Downvote if appropriate, move on.]
```

**Why it works**: Engaging feeds trolls. Ignore and focus on good-faith engagement.

---

### "This is a scam/you're going to steal our data/etc."

**Template**:
```
I understand the skepticism - there are a lot of sketchy platforms.

To be clear:
- [Specific reassurance about concern]
- [What you're NOT doing]
- [How they can verify your claims]

If you're still concerned, totally fair to skip it. No hard feelings.

What would help build trust?
```

**Why it works**: Validates skepticism, specific reassurances, gives them out, asks constructively.

---

## Meta-Responses

### When someone asks really good questions that improve your thinking

**Template**:
```
This is genuinely helpful feedback. You've identified [specific issue]
that I hadn't fully thought through.

I'm going to [specific action you'll take based on their input].

Would you be interested in beta testing? I'd value having your critical
eye on the platform as it develops.
```

**Why it works**: Shows you're listening, commits to action, recruits thoughtful critic.

---

### When conversation in comments is more valuable than the original post

**Template**:
```
This discussion is exactly what I was hoping for. The questions you're
all raising about [topic] are really sharpening my thinking.

I'm taking notes on [specific insights]. This is influencing how I think
about [feature/approach].

Keep the questions/criticisms coming - this is incredibly valuable.
```

**Why it works**: Validates discussion, shows you're learning, encourages more engagement.

---

### When you realize you got something wrong

**Template**:
```
You're absolutely right. I hadn't thought about [specific issue].

This changes how I'm thinking about [feature/approach]. Specifically:
[How you'll adapt based on this feedback]

Thank you for pushing back on this - exactly why I posted here.
```

**Why it works**: Admits error openly, shows how you'll change, appreciates the feedback.

---

## Emergency Responses

### "Wait, this is against subreddit rules!"

**Template**:
```
Oh no - I read the rules but may have misunderstood. Can you point me to
the specific rule I violated?

If this doesn't belong here, I apologize to the community and mods. Not
trying to spam.

[Delete if mods confirm it violates rules]
```

---

### Moderator asks you to remove the post

**Template**:
```
Understood - removing now. Apologies for not catching that in the rules.

Is there a way I could share this that WOULD be appropriate? Or should
I just skip this community for promotion?

Thanks for maintaining the quality of [subreddit].
```

---

### Post is getting brigaded/mass downvoted

**Template (as edit)**:
```
Edit: This seems to have struck a nerve! If this came across wrong,
I apologize.

My intent was [genuine intent]. Happy to answer questions or clarify,
but I understand if this isn't the right community for this.

Appreciate the honest (if harsh) feedback.
```

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

- Show you listened and acted

### Building relationships:
- Continue participating in subreddit
- Help answer others' questions

---

Remember: The goal isn't to "win" arguments or convince everyone. It's to:
1. Learn from the community
2. Find people genuinely interested
3. Build relationships
4. Get honest feedback
5. Show you're a real person building something useful

**Best response is often the one that asks a thoughtful question.**
