## r/philosophy (3 variations)

### Post #1: Meta-Discussion Focus

**Title**: "Is there a better way to discuss philosophy online? Reflecting on the state of digital philosophical discourse"

**Body**:
I've been thinking about the challenges of philosophical discussion in digital spaces:

**Reddit/Twitter**: Great questions get buried under hot takes and bad-faith arguments. Threads disappear after a day.

**Academic spaces**: Often gatekept or intimidating for those without formal training. The "you need to read these 12 books first" gatekeeping is real.

**Debate platforms**: Focus on winning arguments rather than collaborative truth-seeking. Points and rankings incentivize rhetoric over reason.

**Discord/Forums**: Conversations start strong but vanish into endless scrolling. No persistence or structure.

I built ARGUED as an attempt to address these issues - a platform specifically designed for thoughtful philosophical conversation:

- **Persistent discussions**: Reading groups, study circles, and debates that don't disappear
- **Beginner to expert**: Casual questions welcomed alongside deep theoretical discussions
- **Quality over quantity**: Features designed to slow down and deepen conversation
- **Optional AI facilitation**: Socratic questioning and perspective exploration (not judgment or answers)
- **Multiple formats**: Morality problems, dialectical exchanges, collaborative reading

It's early stage (beta) and I'm looking for feedback from people who care about quality philosophical discourse.

**My question for this community**: What makes a good philosophy discussion space? What have you found works, and what frustrates you about current platforms?

Full transparency: I'm the creator and this is very much an early-stage project seeking thoughtful feedback.

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday morning (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Focus on responding to philosophical discussion about digital discourse, not just promoting the tool

### Post #2: Problem-Solution Format

**Title**: "Philosophy discussions online are broken. Here's what I'm trying differently."

**Body**:
Every philosophy community I've been part of has the same problems:

**The Reddit problem**: You write a thoughtful response to "What is justice?" and it gets 3 upvotes while "Justice is just ice LOL" gets 500.

**The academic problem**: Genuine curiosity gets met with "Read Rawls, then Nozick, then Sandel, then we'll talk."

**The debate problem**: Platforms gamify "winning" arguments instead of exploring truth together.

**The Discord problem**: Amazing conversations happen... and then scroll away forever.

So I spent the last few months building ARGUED - not another generic forum, but a platform designed around how philosophical conversation actually works:

**Format diversity**: Not just threads. Reading groups (discuss texts together), Socratic dialogues (structured question-answer), morality problems (explore ethical scenarios), study circles (learn topics collaboratively).

**AI as facilitator, not arbiter**: Optional Socratic questioning to deepen thinking. No "AI judges who won" nonsense.

**Beginner-friendly**: "Is free will real?" is as welcome as "Examining Kant's transcendental deduction."

**Persistent & structured**: Conversations build over time instead of disappearing into the void.

I'm looking for philosophy enthusiasts (any level) to beta test and give brutally honest feedback.

What features would make you actually want to leave Reddit for philosophical discussions?

(I'm the creator, this is early stage, and I genuinely want to build something the philosophy community needs)

**Best time to post**: Thursday/Friday afternoon (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Acknowledge Reddit's strengths while explaining unique value proposition

### Post #3: Personal Story Format

**Title**: "I've been trying to discuss philosophy online for 10 years. I finally built the platform I always wanted."

**Body**:
A decade ago, I discovered philosophy on Reddit. r/philosophy and r/askphilosophy changed my life - they made philosophy accessible when academic spaces felt closed off.

But over the years, I've watched quality philosophical discussion get harder to find:
- Serious questions drowned out by noise
- Conversations that start brilliantly but disappear after 24 hours
- The rise of "debate me" culture that treats philosophy like competitive sport
- Fragmentation across platforms (Reddit for questions, Discord for chat, podcasts for learning - nothing connects)

Last year I asked myself: **What would a platform purpose-built for philosophical conversation look like?**

The result is ARGUED (name might change - feedback welcome):

**Core idea**: Different philosophical activities need different formats
- **Reading groups**: Discuss primary texts together
- **Morality problems**: Explore ethical scenarios
- **Socratic dialogues**: Structured question-answer exchanges
- **Study circles**: Learn philosophical topics collaboratively
- **Debates**: When you actually want to debate a position

**Key principles**:
- Beginner questions welcomed (we all start somewhere)
- AI can facilitate with Socratic questions, but never judges
- Conversations persist and build over time
- Quality over virality

It's very early stage. Rough edges everywhere. But I'm looking for philosophy enthusiasts who want to help shape what this becomes.

**To this community specifically**: You were my gateway to philosophy. What would make you use a platform beyond Reddit for deeper discussions?

(Yes, I'm the creator. Yes, I'm biased. Yes, I genuinely want your critical feedback.)

**Best time to post**: Sunday evening or Monday morning (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Nostalgia + gratitude to r/philosophy community, authentic vulnerability about early stage

## r/askphilosophy (2 variations)

### Post #4: Question-First Approach

**Title**: "Where do you have substantive philosophy discussions online these days?"

**Body**:
I'm curious where people in this community go for ongoing philosophical discussions beyond asking/answering questions.

I love r/askphilosophy for getting quick guidance and reading recommendations, but I'm wondering where people go for:
- Discussing primary texts in depth
- Exploring philosophical problems over multiple exchanges
- Having extended dialectical conversations
- Study groups or collaborative learning

I've tried:
- **Reddit threads**: Great for Q&A, but discussions don't persist
- **Discord servers**: Conversations scroll away too quickly
- **Academic spaces**: Often require institutional access or feel gatekept
- **Debate platforms**: Too focused on "winning"

What's worked for you? Are there platforms, communities, or formats that enable the kind of sustained philosophical conversation that doesn't fit into a single Reddit thread?

(Full disclosure: I'm working on a platform for this exact purpose, but I'm genuinely curious what currently exists and what people actually use. Not trying to promote, just trying to understand the landscape.)

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday (carefully - check subreddit rules first)
**Engagement strategy**: Lead with genuine question, mention project only in disclosure, focus on learning from community

---

### Post #5: Specific Use Case Focus

**Title**: "Resources for philosophical reading groups outside of university?"

**Body**:
Are there good platforms for reading primary philosophical texts with others outside of academic settings?

I'm thinking specifically about:
- Discussing difficult texts (Kant, Hegel, etc.) with structured guidance
- Reading groups that persist over weeks/months
- Mix of experience levels (not just experts or just beginners)
- Socratic dialogue format for working through arguments

I've found podcasts and YouTube helpful for learning, but I want something more interactive. Reddit threads are great for questions but don't really work for sustained textual analysis.

Do such spaces exist? Or is this mostly happening in university seminars and private reading groups?

(Context: I'm exploring building something for this purpose, but want to understand what's already out there and what people actually need. Happy to share what I'm working on if there's interest, but mainly here to learn.)

**Best time to post**: Monday/Thursday (morning EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Very specific use case, defer to community expertise, soft mention of project

## r/SideProject (3 variations)

### Post #6: Technical Builder Focus

**Title**: "Built a philosophical conversation platform with AI-facilitated Socratic dialogues [Beta, seeking feedback]"

**Body**:
**What I built**: A platform for structured philosophical discussions featuring reading groups, morality problem explorations, and AI-facilitated Socratic dialogues.

**The problem**: Philosophy discussions online are either too shallow (social media), too gatekept (academia), or too focused on "winning" (debate platforms). Nowhere really supports the diverse formats that philosophical conversation actually takes.

**The approach**:
- **Multiple conversation formats**: Not just threaded discussions. Reading groups for text analysis, Socratic dialogues for question-answer exchanges, study circles for collaborative learning, morality problems for ethical exploration.
- **AI facilitation (optional)**: Uses Claude to ask Socratic questions and explore perspectives. Crucially: AI facilitates, never judges or declares winners.
- **Persistence**: Conversations structured to build over days/weeks, not disappear in 24 hours.
- **Beginner-friendly**: "What is consciousness?" is as welcome as "Examining Searle's biological naturalism."

**Tech stack**: [Next.js, React, TypeScript - add specific details based on actual stack]

**Current stage**: Early beta. Looking for users who care about quality philosophical discourse to test and give feedback.

**What I'm learning**:
- Balancing structure vs. freedom in conversation formats
- Making AI feel like helpful facilitation, not intrusive judgment
- Onboarding people with different philosophy backgrounds

**What I need feedback on**:
- Does the concept resonate?
- What features would make you actually use this?
- What am I missing?

Happy to answer technical questions or discuss the design decisions.

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday (mid-morning EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Lead with tech/building aspect, be specific about what you're learning

### Post #7: Feedback-Focused

**Title**: "Show SideProject: ARGUED - Philosophy discussion platform (very early beta, roast my approach)"

**Body**:
I'm a philosophy enthusiast who got tired of quality discussions drowning in noise on Reddit/Twitter. So I built a platform specifically for philosophical conversation.

**Core concept**: Different philosophical activities need different formats.

**What it includes**:
1. **Reading Groups**: Discuss primary texts (Plato, Kant, etc.) with structured commentary
2. **Morality Problems**: Explore ethical scenarios together (trolley problems on steroids)
3. **Socratic Dialogues**: Structured question-answer format
4. **Study Circles**: Learn philosophical topics collaboratively
5. **Optional AI**: Socratic questioning to deepen discussion (not judgment)

**Key differentiator**: Quality over virality. Features designed to slow down and deepen conversation rather than maximize engagement metrics.

**Current status**:
- Very early beta
- Core features working but rough
- ~50 test users giving feedback
- Considering rebrand (is "ARGUED" too aggressive?)

**What I need from you**:
- Brutal honesty: Does this solve a real problem?
- Feature gaps: What am I missing?
- Design feedback: What would make you actually use this?

**What I'm struggling with**:
- Onboarding: How to explain "this isn't just another forum"
- Growth: How to get initial users without compromising quality
- Sustainability: Monetization that doesn't ruin the experience

Tear this apart. What should I change?

[Link would go here]

**Best time to post**: Thursday/Friday afternoon (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Invite criticism, show specific struggles, ask direct questions

### Post #8: Journey/Process Focus

**Title**: "Built a philosophy platform because I couldn't find where to discuss Kant without gatekeeping or memes [3 months, seeking beta testers]"

**Body**:
**The journey**: I've wanted to discuss philosophy online for years but kept hitting the same walls:

- Reddit: Great content drowns in noise, serious questions get meme responses
- Twitter: Character limits kill nuance
- Academic spaces: "Come back when you've read the entire Western canon"
- Debate platforms: Gamification of "winning" arguments
- Discord: Great conversations scroll away forever

**The experiment**: What if I built a platform specifically for how philosophical conversation actually works?

**What I shipped** (3 months of nights/weekends):
- **Format diversity**: Reading groups, Socratic dialogues, morality problems, study circles
- **AI facilitation**: Optional Socratic questioning (using Claude API)
- **Beginner-friendly**: Casual questions alongside expert discussions
- **Persistent**: Conversations structured to build over time

**What I learned**:
- Philosophy enthusiasts REALLY care about quality over quantity
- AI can facilitate well if it asks questions rather than gives answers
- Onboarding is hard - "it's not a forum" is hard to explain
- The name "ARGUED" gets mixed reactions (might rebrand)

**What I'm testing**:
- Do people actually want structured formats, or do they prefer free-form?
- Is AI facilitation helpful or annoying?
- Can we balance beginner-friendly with intellectual rigor?

**What I need**: Beta testers who care about philosophical conversation and will give honest feedback.

**Tech**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Claude API

Feedback, questions, criticism all welcome. What would make you use this?

[Link would go here]

**Best time to post**: Monday morning or Wednesday afternoon (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Tell the story, show learning process, technical transparency

## r/Stoicism (2 posts)

### Post #9: Community-First Approach

**Title**: "Looking for Stoic practitioners interested in deeper online discussions [New platform for structured philosophical dialogue]"

**Body**:
I practice Stoicism and regularly come to this subreddit for wisdom and perspective. But I've noticed something:

**Great discussions happen here**, but they're limited by Reddit's format:
- Threads disappear after a few days
- Difficult to have sustained dialogue on a single topic
- Hard to work through a Stoic text together (Meditations, Discourses, etc.)
- Challenge finding study partners for deeper practice

I built a platform specifically for sustained philosophical conversation, and I'm looking for Stoic practitioners to help shape a dedicated Stoicism section.

**What it offers**:
- **Reading groups** for working through Stoic texts together (start with Meditations or Enchiridion)
- **Practical scenarios** for discussing Stoic responses to modern challenges
- **Study circles** for learning Stoic concepts collaboratively
- **Socratic dialogues** for examining our understanding of Stoic principles

**What makes it different**: Designed for conversations that build over days/weeks, not just quick Q&A. Optional AI facilitation to ask Socratic questions (never preachy, just questioning).

**What I need**: Stoics (any level - beginner to expert) willing to test this and tell me honestly if it's useful for your practice.

**My commitment**: If this serves the Stoic community, I'll keep developing Stoicism-specific features. If it doesn't, I want to know early.

Does this sound useful? What features would help your Stoic practice?

(I'm the creator, it's early stage, and I'm genuinely building this for communities like r/Stoicism)

**Best time to post**: Sunday evening or Monday morning (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Respect the community, show knowledge of Stoicism, focus on practical benefits

---

### Post #10: Practical Focus

**Title**: "Created a space for working through Stoic texts together (starting with Meditations)"

**Body**:
**Quick question**: How many of you have started reading Marcus Aurelius's Meditations but wished you had someone to discuss passages with?

I love this community, but I've found Reddit isn't ideal for:
- Sustained textual analysis over multiple sessions
- Working through Stoic exercises together
- Discussing how ancient Stoic wisdom applies to modern scenarios
- Finding consistent study partners

So I created ARGUED - a platform specifically for structured philosophical discussion. I'm starting a Stoicism section and looking for interested practitioners.

**What I'm planning**:
- **Weekly Meditations reading group**: One book per week, structured discussion
- **Stoic practice scenarios**: Modern situations, discuss Stoic responses
- **Concept deep-dives**: Systematic study of core Stoic ideas (dichotomy of control, preferred indifferents, etc.)

**Format**: Persistent discussions that build over days, optional AI Socratic questioning to deepen reflection, mix of experience levels welcome.

**Current status**: Beta. Rough around edges. But functional and ready for Stoics who want deeper engagement than typical Reddit threads.

**What I need**: 10-15 Stoics willing to join the first Meditations reading group starting next week.

Interested? What would make this valuable for your practice?

(Full transparency: I'm the creator and this is early stage. Building this for communities that value depth over virality.)

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday (evening EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Specific call-to-action (reading group), practical benefits, time-bound commitment

## r/existentialism (2 posts)

### Post #11: Authenticity Focus

**Title**: "Built a platform for existentialist discussion that doesn't feel like performing for an audience"

**Body**:
There's something ironic about discussing authenticity on platforms optimized for performance.

On Reddit/Twitter, even our most genuine philosophical questions become content. We write for upvotes, not understanding. We perform existential angst instead of genuinely wrestling with it.

I wanted a space where discussing Camus's absurdism or Sartre's radical freedom didn't feel like creating content for an algorithm.

**ARGUED** is my attempt - a platform for philosophical conversation that prioritizes depth over virality:

**What's different**:
- **No upvotes/downvotes**: Your ideas aren't competing for attention
- **Persistent discussions**: Conversations build over days/weeks, not hours
- **Multiple formats**: Reading groups (work through Sartre together), dialogues (explore ideas dialectically), scenarios (existential questions in modern contexts)
- **Optional AI facilitation**: Socratic questions to deepen thinking, never judgment

**Why existentialism specifically**:
Existentialist thought requires sustained, uncomfortable questioning. Quick Reddit threads don't capture the experience of genuinely confronting freedom, absurdity, or bad faith.

**What I'm building**:
- Reading group for "Existentialism is a Humanism" starting next week
- Collection of modern existential scenarios for discussion
- Space for authentic philosophical struggle, not performance

**Current state**: Early beta. I'm the creator. Looking for existentialists (any background) to test this and tell me if it actually serves our needs.

**Question for this community**: What would make you choose a different platform over Reddit for existentialist discussion? What's missing?

**Best time to post**: Thursday/Friday (evening EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Meta-commentary on authenticity, align with existentialist values, invite genuine reflection

---

### Post #12: Text-Based Focus

**Title**: "Starting a reading group for 'The Myth of Sisyphus' - looking for discussion partners [New platform]"

**Body**:
I want to work through Camus's "The Myth of Sisyphus" with others, but Reddit isn't really built for sustained textual analysis.

So I'm using a platform I built for exactly this purpose - structured philosophical discussion that persists over time.

**The plan**:
- **Text**: "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus
- **Format**: One section per week, structured discussion
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Level**: All backgrounds welcome (we'll support each other)
- **Style**: Collaborative exploration, not lecture

**Platform features**:
- Persistent discussion threads for each section
- Optional AI Socratic questioning to deepen analysis
- Space for both textual analysis and personal reflection
- Focus on understanding, not performing intelligence

**Why not just use Reddit**:
- Discussions disappear too quickly
- Hard to maintain continuity over 4 weeks
- Format doesn't support sustained dialectical exchange

**What I need**: 8-10 people genuinely interested in working through Camus together. Any level of philosophical background - curiosity matters more than credentials.

**Starting**: Next Monday (if we get enough interest)

**Full disclosure**: I built this platform (ARGUED) specifically for this kind of philosophical reading. It's early stage, definitely rough, but functional. I'm looking for people who value depth over polish.

Interested? What questions do you have?

**Best time to post**: Sunday evening or Wednesday (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Specific, actionable proposal, low barrier to entry, time-bound commitment

## r/changemyview (2 variations)

### Post #13: Respectful Complement Approach

**Title**: "I love CMV's mission, but what if we wanted to explore truth together instead of changing minds? [Built alternative]"

**Body**:
I've learned so much from r/changemyview. The format of defending a view and genuinely engaging with counterarguments is powerful.

But I've noticed I sometimes want something different: **Not to change someone's mind or have mine changed, but to collaboratively explore a philosophical question.**

Examples:
- "What is the nature of consciousness?" - Not trying to convince, just exploring perspectives
- "How should we think about moral responsibility?" - Not defending a position, genuinely uncertain
- "What makes something beautiful?" - Want dialogue, not debate

**CMV is perfect for** "I believe X, change my view"
**What about** "I'm genuinely puzzled by X, let's explore together"?

I built ARGUED as a complement (not replacement!) to CMV for this kind of philosophical exploration:

**Different from CMV**:
- **Goal**: Collaborative truth-seeking, not mind-changing
- **Format**: Multiple types (Socratic dialogues, reading groups, study circles)
- **Tone**: Uncertainty welcomed, not just confident views
- **Persistence**: Conversations build over days/weeks
- **Optional AI**: Socratic questions, never judgment

**Similar to CMV**:
- Serious engagement with ideas
- Good-faith discussion
- Intellectual rigor

I'm not trying to replace CMV (impossible! this community is amazing). Just offering an alternative for when you want collaborative exploration instead of view-changing.

**Question**: Do y'all ever feel like you want philosophical discussion that isn't framed as debate or persuasion? Or is the CMV format what makes it work?

(I'm the creator, early stage, genuinely curious if this serves a different need)

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday (afternoon EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Deep respect for CMV community, position as complement not competitor, acknowledge what CMV does well

---

### Post #14: Use Case Comparison

**Title**: "CMV for debates. What for genuine philosophical uncertainty? [Seeking feedback on alternative]"

**Body**:
I love coming to CMV when I have a view I want tested. The format forces intellectual honesty and good-faith engagement.

But what platform do you use when you're genuinely uncertain and want to explore?

**CMV works when**:
- "I believe capital punishment is wrong, CMV"
- You have a position to defend
- You want counterarguments

**I'm building for**:
- "I'm genuinely confused about free will and determinism"
- You don't have a position yet
- You want collaborative exploration

**Different format**:
- **Socratic dialogues**: Question-answer format for examining beliefs
- **Reading groups**: Work through philosophical texts together
- **Study circles**: Learn topics collaboratively, not competitively
- **Morality problems**: Explore ethical scenarios without predetermined positions

**Different goal**: Not "change my view" but "help me understand this together"

**What I need feedback on**:
- Is this solving a real need, or is CMV already sufficient?
- What would make you use a different platform for philosophical exploration?
- What's missing from this approach?

It's called ARGUED (name might change) and it's very early stage. I'm the creator and genuinely trying to understand if this serves a different purpose than CMV.

**To this community**: You're experts at productive philosophical discourse. What would make a "collaborative exploration" platform actually useful?

**Best time to post**: Thursday/Friday (morning EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Clear differentiation from CMV, defer to community expertise, ask genuine questions

## r/AlphaandBetausers (2 variations)

### Post #15: Direct Beta Call

**Title**: "[Beta] Philosophy discussion platform - need 20-30 users to stress-test conversation formats"

**Body**:
**Product**: ARGUED - Platform for structured philosophical discussion (reading groups, Socratic dialogues, study circles)

**Stage**: Early beta - core features working, need real users to stress-test

**What I'm testing**:
1. **Conversation formats**: Do structured formats (Socratic dialogue, reading groups) work better than free-form?
2. **AI facilitation**: Is AI Socratic questioning helpful or annoying?
3. **Onboarding**: Can people understand "not just another forum" quickly?
4. **Engagement**: Do persistent discussions retain users better than threaded forums?

**What I need from beta testers**:
- **Time commitment**: 2-3 hours/week for 2 weeks
- **Activity**: Participate in at least 2 different conversation formats
- **Feedback**: Weekly survey (10 min) + optional deeper interview
- **Honesty**: Tell me what's broken, what's confusing, what's missing

**What you get**:
- Early access and lifetime premium features
- Direct influence on product development
- Space for quality philosophical discussion (if it works!)
- Optional: Listed as founding beta tester

**Ideal beta tester**:

**Best time to post**: Monday morning (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Clear expectations, specific asks, emphasize active participation needed

---

### Post #16: Specific Feature Testing

**Title**: "[Beta] Testing AI-facilitated Socratic dialogues for philosophical discussion - need 15 users"

**Body**:
**Specific feature I'm testing**: AI-facilitated Socratic dialogues for philosophical discussion

**How it works**:
1. User poses a philosophical question or belief
2. AI asks Socratic questions to examine assumptions
3. Human participants can join the dialogue at any point
4. AI never judges or gives answers, only questions

**Example flow**:
- User: "I believe free will is incompatible with determinism"
- AI: "What do you mean by 'free will' in this context?"
- User: [Response]
- AI: "How would you know if you had free will?"
- Another user: "I'd push back on that definition because..."

**What I'm testing**:
- Does AI facilitation deepen discussion or feel gimmicky?
- Should AI step back when humans engage?
- How much Socratic questioning is helpful vs annoying?
- Does this format lead to better philosophical insights than normal threads?

**What I need**:
- **15 beta testers** willing to participate in 3-5 Socratic dialogues over 2 weeks
- Mix of philosophy backgrounds (beginners and experts both needed)
- Detailed feedback survey after each dialogue
- Optional: 30-minute interview at end

**Time commitment**:
- 3-5 dialogues (30-45 min each)
- Quick feedback after each (5 min)
- Total: ~4 hours over 2 weeks

**You get**:
- Free access to the platform
- Direct input on how AI facilitation works
- Interesting philosophical discussions (hopefully!)

**The platform**: ARGUED - philosophical discussion platform I'm building. Early stage, rough edges, but this specific feature is ready to test.

**Starting**: This Thursday

**Apply**: [Form link] or comment your philosophy background and what interests you about Socratic dialogues

I'm the creator. This is my first time building AI-facilitated features. I need honest feedback on whether this actually works or if I should scrap it.

**Best time to post**: Tuesday/Wednesday (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Very specific feature testing, clear time commitment, emphasize need for honest feedback

## r/PhilosophyMemes (2 posts)

### Post #17: Self-Aware Meta Approach

**Title**: "Made a philosophy platform to escape Reddit philosophy discussions. Posted on Reddit to promote it. Camus would be proud."

**Body**:
The absurdity is not lost on me.

I got tired of:
- "Is water wet?" debates
- "Nietzsche would have loved Joker" takes
- Philosophy discussion drowning in memes (no offense, I'm here aren't I?)

So I built ARGUED - a platform for actual philosophical discussion. Reading groups, Socratic dialogues, study circles. The whole Platonic ideal of discourse.

Then realized I need to promote it on... Reddit. The very place I was trying to escape.

One must imagine me happy. Or at least consistently absurd.

**What it actually is**: Platform for structured philosophy discussion. Different formats for different needs. Optional AI Socratic questioning. No memes (you'll have to come here for those).

**Current status**: Beta. Probably has bugs. Definitely has existential irony.

**Who it's for**: People who like philosophy memes but also occasionally want to discuss the actual philosophy.

If you've ever thought "I should read more Camus" after upvoting a Sisyphus meme, this might be for you.

Or don't join. The absurd hero neither needs nor seeks justification.

**Best time to post**: Friday afternoon or weekend (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Lean into the irony, keep it light, show you understand the community

### Post #18: Meme-Format But Real

**Title**: "POV: You're trying to have a serious philosophy discussion on Reddit"

**Body**:
**What you post**: "Examining the phenomenological implications of embodied cognition in Merleau-Ponty's later work"

**What you get**:
- "This guy philosophizes" (500 upvotes)
- "Read another book" (200 upvotes)
- "Actually if you read the original French..." (100 upvotes, -50 by next day)
- One really good response (3 upvotes, buried)

**So I built**: Platform specifically for the philosophy discussions that deserve more than meme responses.

**Features**:
- Reading groups for actually reading those books
- Socratic dialogues for examining beliefs
- No upvotes/downvotes to chase
- Optional AI to ask annoying Socratic questions (so you don't have to)
- Persistent discussions that don't disappear

**Name**: ARGUED (might rebrand, taking suggestions)

**Status**: Beta, early, probably buggy, but functional

**Best use**: When you've finished laughing at the Diogenes memes and actually want to discuss Cynicism

**Not replacing**: Philosophy memes. We still need those.

**Target audience**: People who know the difference between Kant and kant even

If you've ever wished the good Reddit philosophy discussions didn't get buried under "Is cereal soup?", give it a try.

[Link would go here]

Or stay here for the memes. Both valid life choices. Probably what Diogenes would want.

**Best time to post**: Weekend (EST)
**Engagement strategy**: Match the meme tone, self-deprecating humor, acknowledge what the community values
