**Ready-to-Post Content (3 variations):**

*Variation 1 - Technical Problem Focus:*
```
Hey HN,

I built ARGUED to solve a problem I kept running into: having interesting
philosophical discussions online always devolved into noise. Reddit threads
get buried, Twitter optimizes for hot takes, and academic forums are ghost
towns with terrible UX.

I wanted structured debates where arguments are judged on merit (logic,
evidence, rhetoric) rather than popularity. So I built a platform where
Gemini 2.5 Flash acts as an impartial judge, scoring arguments and providing
detailed reasoning.

Technical approach:
- Next.js 15 (App Router) for the frontend
- Supabase for auth, database, and real-time subscriptions
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI judgment with custom prompting
- TypeScript throughout for type safety

Interesting technical challenges:
1. AI Judgment Consistency - Getting Gemini to be fair required careful
   prompt engineering. I score three dimensions separately and aggregate.
2. Fact-checking integration - AI identifies factual claims and flags them
3. Real-time debate updates - Using Supabase subscriptions for live updates

What I'm looking for feedback on:
- Is AI judgment fair enough? How would you improve the scoring?
- Tech stack thoughts? Any gotchas with this architecture at scale?

Try it out: [url]

Built this mostly solo over the past few months. Would love to hear what
HN thinks—both on the concept and the technical execution.
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Minimum: 20+ points, 10+ comments, 30+ signups
- Good: Front page (50+ points), 30+ comments, 100+ signups
- Exceptional: Top 10, 100+ points, 50+ quality comments, 300+ signups

- Host office hours or AMA if interest is high

**Ready-to-Post Template:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm [name], and I just launched ARGUED - a platform for philosophical
discussions where arguments are judged on reasoning quality, not popularity.

Quick backstory: I love philosophy, but I kept running into the same problem
on Reddit/Twitter - good arguments get buried under hot takes. So I built
a platform where Gemini AI judges arguments on logic, evidence, and rhetoric.

What makes it different:
🤖 AI judgment (fair scoring, detailed feedback)
📊 Reputation system (earn points for quality reasoning)
🎯 Multiple formats (debates, reading groups, Socratic dialogues)
📚 All levels welcome (beginner to expert)

For this Discord community specifically: I'd love your feedback on whether
this actually solves a real problem. And if it resonates, I'm happy to
create a dedicated channel for [server topic].

Check it out: [link with UTM: ?utm_source=discord&utm_medium=[servername]]

Happy to answer questions! (And yes, I'm the creator, so I'm biased 😊)

**Time Investment:** 12 hours (posting + engagement)

**Priority Subreddits (Week 1-4):**

- **Day 5:** r/AlphaandBetausers (beta testing angle)

**Best Performing Template (r/SideProject):**
```
Title: "Built a philosophical conversation platform with AI-facilitated
Socratic dialogues [Beta, seeking feedback]"

Body:
**What I built**: A platform for structured philosophical discussions
featuring reading groups, morality problem explorations, and AI-facilitated
Socratic dialogues.

**The problem**: Philosophy discussions online are either too shallow
(social media), too gatekept (academia), or too focused on "winning"
(debate platforms). Nowhere supports the diverse formats that philosophical
conversation actually takes.

**The approach**:
- Multiple conversation formats (reading groups, Socratic dialogues, debates)
- AI facilitation (Claude asks Socratic questions, never judges)
- Persistence (conversations build over days/weeks)
- Beginner-friendly ("What is consciousness?" as welcome as expert debates)

**Tech stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase, Gemini API

**Current stage**: Early beta. Looking for users who care about quality
philosophical discourse to test and give feedback.

**What I'm learning**:
- Balancing structure vs. freedom in conversation formats
- Making AI feel helpful, not intrusive
- Onboarding people with different philosophy backgrounds

**What I need feedback on**:
- Does the concept resonate?
- What features would make you actually use this?
- What am I missing?

```

**Posting Best Practices:**
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11 AM EST or 1-3 PM EST
- Respond to first comment within 5 minutes
- Engage with ALL comments in first 2 hours
- Don't be salesy - focus on discussion
- Track what works (UTM parameters)

#### 5. Twitter/X (#PhilTwitter) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Why Important:** Philosophy community hub, influencer reach, viral potential

**Expected Signups:** 100-300
**Success Criteria:** 50+ retweets, 200+ likes, influencer engagement
**Time Investment:** 8 hours (threading + engagement)

**Launch Day Thread (6:00 AM PST):**

```
Thread 1/12: Where do you actually discuss philosophy online?

Not consume it. Not scroll past quotes. Actually DEBATE ideas with other
humans.

I searched for 6 months. Here's what I found (and what I built about it) 🧵

---

2/12: Reddit? Discussions get buried in hours.
Good post? Gone by tomorrow.
Want to revisit? Good luck finding it.

Philosophy threads deserve better than 24-hour shelf life.

---

3/12: Twitter? You're here, so you know.
Character limits kill nuance.
Ratio culture punishes careful thinking.
"Dunks" get 10k likes. Thoughtful replies get 3.

---

4/12: Discord? Real-time is great for chat.
Terrible for:
- Finding that brilliant point someone made 3 weeks ago
- Onboarding new people to ongoing discussions
- Persistent, citable philosophical arguments

---

5/12: Academic journals? Peer review takes 18 months.
By then, you've forgotten what you were arguing about.

We need the middle ground: Serious but accessible. Fast but persistent.

---

6/12: So I built ARGUED.

What if philosophical arguments were judged on:
✅ Logic (sound reasoning)
✅ Evidence (supported claims)
✅ Rhetoric (clarity, structure)

Instead of:
❌ Who has more followers
❌ Who posted first
❌ Who's better at Twitter dunks

---

7/12: How it works:

1. You pick a philosophical topic
2. Submit your argument
3. Gemini AI judges it on logic, evidence, rhetoric
4. Get detailed feedback
5. Build reputation through quality reasoning

No popularity contests. No karma farming. Just: Is your argument good?

---

8/12: "But can AI fairly judge philosophy?"

Fair question. Here's what I learned building this:
- AI is surprisingly good at catching logical fallacies
- It can identify unsupported claims
- Detailed feedback is actually useful
- Not perfect, but better than mob voting

---

9/12: This isn't replacing Twitter/Reddit/Discord.

It's for when you want:
- Structured philosophical debate
- Fair evaluation of arguments
- Discussions that don't disappear
- To actually change your mind (or change others')

---

10/12: Early beta. Rough edges. But functional.

Perfect for:
✅ Philosophy students practicing argumentation
✅ Curious learners wanting feedback
✅ People who love ideas more than winning

Try it: [https://argued.app?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=launch]

---

11/12: We're also on @ProductHunt today!

If this resonates, would love your support: [PH link]

And if you have feedback (especially criticism), I want to hear it.

---

12/12: Philosophy is about thinking clearly together.

Not about winning Twitter arguments.

Let's build a better place for it.

Thanks for reading 🙏

## 4. Community Seeding Plan

### Purpose
A platform for philosophical conversations is only valuable if conversations are happening. This plan ensures quality content exists before public launch to avoid the "ghost town" effect.

### First 10 Seed Discussions (Create Pre-Launch)

#### Mix of Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner-Friendly (40%):** Classic thought experiments, accessible questions
- **Intermediate (40%):** Requires some background, specific movements/figures
- **Advanced (20%):** Technical, assumes philosophical training

#### Content Mix
- **40%** beginner-friendly
- **40%** intermediate
- **20%** advanced/expert
- Mix of timeless and contemporary topics

### The First 10 Discussions

#### 1. The Trolley Problem (Classic, Accessible)
**Format:** Unstructured conversation
**Title:** "The Trolley Problem: Still Relevant or Philosophical Cliché?"
**Why:** Accessible entry point, encourages diverse responses, allows beginner and expert engagement

**Opening Post:**
```
The trolley problem is probably philosophy's most famous thought experiment -
and also maybe its most overused. But I think there's value in revisiting
classics.

For those unfamiliar: You see a runaway trolley heading toward five people.
You can pull a lever to divert it to a track where it will kill one person
instead. Do you pull the lever?

Standard responses often invoke consequentialism (minimize deaths) vs
deontology (don't actively kill). But I'm curious:

1. Does the trolley problem actually illuminate anything about real-world
   moral decisions?
2. Has it become a meme that obscures rather than clarifies?
3. What do the variations (fat man on bridge, loop track, etc.) add?

What's your take? And if you think it's overplayed, what thought experiment
would you put in its place?
```

---

#### 2. Reading Group - Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
**Format:** Reading group
**Title:** "Reading Group: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations (Book 1)"
**Why:** Shows reading group functionality, accessible classical text

**Opening Post:**
```
Starting a reading group for Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Planning to go
through it book by book, discussing as we go.

This week: Book 1, where Marcus lists things he's learned from various
people in his life.

A few discussion questions to start:
- What do you make of the format (listing influences rather than systematic
  arguments)?
- Marcus credits different people for teaching him different virtues. Who
  has shaped your philosophical thinking and how?
- He mentions learning "not to be a partisan of the Greens or Blues at the
  races." What's the modern equivalent of this advice?

Text is public domain and available free many places. Let's read and discuss
Book 1 this week.

Who's in?
```

### Week-by-Week Seeding Strategy

#### Pre-Launch Week
**Goal:** 8-10 quality discussions seeded before opening to public

**Actions:**
- Create discussions 1-10 above
- Have 2-3 beta users engage with each
- Generate 3-5 meaningful comments per discussion
- Test all features (debates, reading groups, threading)

**Ideal State at Launch:**
- 8-10 diverse discussions
- 3-7 comments each
- Mix of formats and topics
- Genuine engagement, not fake activity

---

#### Launch Week (Week 1)
**Goal:** Showcase platform to first users, encourage participation

**Day 1-2:** Monitor for first users, welcome warmly, point to relevant discussions
**Day 3-4:** Encourage early users to start discussions, engage enthusiastically
**Day 5-7:** Create 2-3 new seed discussions if gaps exist

**Engagement Goals:**
- Respond to every new user who posts
- Get at least 3 comments on every new discussion
- Identify 5-10 power users to nurture

---

#### Week 2: Establishing Rhythm
**Goal:** Develop regular cadence, establish norms

**Content:** Create 2-3 new discussions per week
**Community:** Host first office hours or AMA
**Features:** Showcase different features through use

**Target:** Users creating 50% of content by end of week

---

#### Week 3-4: Community Ownership
**Goal:** Users create most content, platform steps back

**Content Shift:** Platform creates only 1-2 discussions per week
**Focus:** Facilitating user content, not creating
**Transition:** If users creating good content → step back more

**Target:** Users creating 80%+ of content by Week 4

---

### Making It Not Look Empty

#### The Ghost Town Problem
**Challenge:** New users see empty platform and leave.

**Solution Techniques:**

1. **Diversity of Voices** - Use beta users with different perspectives, vary writing styles
2. **Realistic Engagement** - Better 5 discussions with 5 comments than 25 with 0
3. **Time Distribution** - Spread discussion creation over time, space out responses
4. **Quality Over Quantity** - 10 great discussions > 50 mediocre ones
5. **Mix Content Ages** - Some recent, some week-old (shows persistence)
6. **Honest About Stage** - "We're early, about X users - help us build this"

#### What "Healthy Early-Stage" Looks Like

**At Launch:**
- 8-10 discussions
- 3-7 comments per discussion
- Mix of formats and topics
- Spread over last week or two

**After 1 Week:**
- 15-20 total discussions
- Mix of platform and user-created
- 10-20 total users participating
- Active engagement on half of discussions

**After 1 Month:**
- 30-50 total discussions
- Majority user-created
- 50-100 active users
- Several ongoing reading groups
- Daily new content (mostly from users)

---

Hacker News:
?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=show_hn&utm_campaign=launch_2025

Reddit:

Discord:
?utm_source=discord&utm_medium=[servername]&utm_campaign=launch_2025

```

#### Master Tracking Spreadsheet

**Columns:**
- Date/Time Posted
- Platform
- Post Title
- Link to Post
- UTM Code
- Clicks
- Signups
- Active Users (7-day)
- Retention (30-day)
- Quality Score (1-10)
- Notes

---

### Quality vs Quantity Metrics

#### Quality Score Formula
```
Quality Score = (Active Users / Total Signups) × 100

Example:
- Product Hunt: 200 signups, 80 active = 40% quality score
- Reddit: 150 signups, 90 active = 60% quality score
→ Reddit drove better quality despite fewer total signups
```

#### Retention by Channel

Track in cohorts:
- Week 1 retention by source
- Week 2 retention by source
- Week 4 retention by source

**Identify:**
- Which channels drive "sticky" users?
- Which drive one-time curious visitors?
- Where to double down vs deprioritize?

---

### Weekly Review Template

**For Each Channel:**
```
CHANNEL: [Product Hunt / Hacker News / Reddit / etc.]

This Week:
- Posts: [number]
- Traffic: [visits]
- Signups: [number]

- Community fit (users understand and embrace platform values)

#### Pivot Away When:
- High signups but low activation
- Users don't match target audience
- Engagement is low-quality or toxic
- ROI on time investment is poor

## 6. Launch Day Emergency Protocols

### Product Hunt Launch Failing

**Symptoms:** Not breaking Top 20 by noon

**Actions:**
1. Alert PH support network (again)
2. Share on all personal social channels
3. Engage more heavily in comments (every 5 min)
4. Post update with new feature or insight
5. Cross-promote from HN/Reddit if those are going well
6. Remain positive and engaged regardless

**DON'T:** Ask for upvotes publicly, get defensive, give up on engagement

---

### Hacker News Post Flagged/Dead

**Symptoms:** Post disappears or marked [dead]

**Actions:**
1. Email hn@ycombinator.com politely asking why
2. Review HN guidelines - did you violate anything?
3. Don't repost immediately
4. If unjustified, community members can vouch to revive
5. Try again in 60+ days with different approach

**DON'T:** Complain publicly, repost immediately, argue with moderators

---

### Reddit Spam Ban

**Symptoms:** Post removed, account shadowbanned

**Actions:**
1. Message subreddit moderators politely
2. Check if you violated self-promotion rules
3. Don't delete the post
4. Wait 7+ days before any new promotional posts
5. Return to value-only contributions
6. Build more karma before trying again

**DON'T:** Delete and repost, argue with mods, create new accounts

---

### Server Crashes During Launch

**Symptoms:** Site down or very slow during high traffic

**Actions:**
1. Immediately post status update on all platforms
2. Be transparent and humble about the issue
3. Collect emails for those who want to try later
4. Turn crisis into story ("Overwhelmed by response...")
5. Keep people engaged while fixing
6. Follow up personally when back up

**DON'T:** Go silent, make excuses, blame hosting provider publicly

---

### Low Engagement on Launch Day

**Symptoms:** Few upvotes, few comments, low traffic

**Actions:**
1. Assess: Is it the platform, timing, or message?
2. Engage extra heavily with any comments
3. Share to personal network
4. Try different platform if one isn't working
5. Adjust messaging for next platform
6. Remember: Some great products had quiet launches

**DON'T:** Spam more platforms out of panic, get discouraged and quit

---

## 7. Key Principles & Reminders

### Core Philosophy

**Quality Over Quantity**
Better to have 100 engaged philosophers than 10,000 lurkers. Every strategy prioritizes quality users who will shape platform culture.

**Authentic Over Promotional**
Share learnings, not just links. Focus on discussion, value, and community - not selling.

**Responsive Over Scheduled**
Engage genuinely with every comment. First 2 hours of any post are critical.

**Community Over Growth**
Build culture early, growth follows. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

**Patient Over Pushy**
Good communities take time. Don't force growth if community isn't ready.

---

### Launch Day Reminders

- **Respond to EVERY comment** (within 15 minutes in first 6 hours)
- **Be humble and authentic** (not defensive or salesy)
- **Accept criticism gracefully** (it's feedback, not attack)
- **Show, don't just tell** (link to examples, invite to try)
- **Track everything** (you'll want this data for post-mortem)
- **Stay engaged all day** (first 6 hours are critical)
- **Celebrate small wins** (every genuine interest is a win)
- **Don't panic if slow start** (some great products had quiet launches)

---

### What Success Actually Looks Like

**Not just numbers.** The real success signals are:

✅ Users telling friends without prompting
✅ Passionate feedback (positive and negative)
✅ Users spending significant time
✅ Users contributing (not just consuming)
✅ Users defending it in other forums
✅ Users feeling ownership ("our community")

**If you have this, numbers will follow. If you don't, no metric optimization will help.**

## 10. Brand & Positioning Context

### Current Positioning Challenge

**Current:** "ARGUED - Where Quality Arguments Matter" / "Chess.com for philosophy"

**Problem:** Emphasizes competition, winning, adversarial framing
- Attracts: 15-20% (competitive debaters, skill validators)
- Repels: 80-85% (collaborative learners, casual questioners, beginners)

**Alignment with Conversation-First Vision:** NO ❌

---

### Recommended Positioning

**For:** People curious about philosophy - from casual questioners to serious scholars

**Who:** Want to explore ideas deeply and connect with other thinkers

**Our Platform Is:** A philosophical conversation ecosystem

**That:** Offers everything from quick questions to rigorous debates, from solo learning to intellectual friendship

**Unlike:** Reddit (too casual/toxic), academic journals (too exclusive/slow), debate platforms (too adversarial)

**We:** Combine depth, accessibility, and community - where conversation matters more than competition

---

### Positioning by Audience

**For Curious Beginners:**
"Get answers to life's big questions from a knowledgeable, welcoming community. No philosophy degree required."

**For Philosophy Students:**
"Study with peers, debate ideas, get feedback on arguments in a supportive academic community."

**For Academics:**
"Engage in rigorous philosophical discourse with equals - structured debates, collaborative research, expert community."

**For Casual Thinkers:**
"Explore philosophical ideas without intimidation - discuss shower thoughts and life's big questions in friendly conversation."

**For Competitive Debaters:**
"Test your philosophical argumentation against skilled opponents in structured debates with fair judging."

---

### Top 3 Taglines

1. **"From Casual Questions to Deep Debates"** (46/50)
   - Perfectly captures spectrum positioning
   - Inclusive to all levels

2. **"Serious Thinking, Friendly Conversation"** (46/50)
   - Balances rigor and accessibility

3. **"Think deeply together"** (45/50)
