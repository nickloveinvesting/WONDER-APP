- **Time saved:** 30-40 hours
- **ROI:** High (your time worth more than $20/hr)

- **Who:** Fiverr designer ($75-150)
- **What they deliver:** All iOS icon sizes, source files
- **Time saved:** 8-12 hours
- **ROI:** Medium-High (professional polish worth it)

### 3.3 What NOT to Outsource

**Vision & Strategy:** ❌ DON'T OUTSOURCE

**Database Schema Design:** ❌ DON'T OUTSOURCE
- Too specific to your vision
- Changes are easy with Supabase

**Community Moderation:** ❌ DON'T OUTSOURCE (initially)
- Culture is set in early days
- Founder sets tone and values
- Hire moderators later (Month 6+)

**Feature Prioritization:** ❌ DON'T OUTSOURCE

## Part 9: Key Financial Decisions

### Decision 1: DIY Frontend vs Hire Developer

**DIY (Recommended):**
- Cost: $0
- Time: 100-150 hours
- Quality: Good (with Claude Code)
- Learning: High
- Control: Complete

**Hire Developer:**
- Cost: $4,000-6,000
- Time saved: 90-120 hours
- Quality: Potentially better
- Learning: Lower
- Control: Requires detailed specs

**Recommendation:** DIY with Claude Code
- You already have working codebase
- Vision is evolving (hard to spec)
- Learning pays dividends later
- Save $4-6K for marketing/iOS
- Can always hire later if stuck

---

### Decision 2: Timing of iOS Deployment

**Option A: Web-First (Recommended)**
- Launch web app first (Month 6)
- iOS follows 1-2 months later (Month 7-8)
- Validate demand before iOS investment
- Faster initial launch
- Lower risk

**Option B: Simultaneous Launch**
- Web + iOS same day
- Bigger launch moment
- Higher upfront costs
- More complexity
- Higher risk if features incomplete

**Recommendation:** Web-first
- Prove demand first
- Iterate faster on web
- iOS deployment is 3-4 weeks
- Can announce "iOS coming soon" at launch
- Less overwhelming

---

### Decision 3: Marketing Budget Allocation

**Organic-Only (Recommended Year 1):**
- Cost: $100-300 (tools, small tests)
- Reach: Limited but targeted
- Quality: Higher (self-selected users)
- Learning: Understand organic channels
- Sustainability: Builds foundation

**Paid Ads Heavy:**
- Cost: $2,000-5,000+
- Reach: Potentially higher
- Quality: Mixed (paid traffic)
- Learning: Expensive lessons
- Sustainability: Depends on CAC/LTV

**Recommendation:** 90% organic, 10% paid tests
- Spend most time on organic (Reddit, HN, forums)
- $50-100 tests on Reddit ads, philosophy podcasts
- Optimize organic first, scale paid later
- Philosophy community responds well to organic
- Save paid budget for when CAC/LTV proven

---

## Part 10: Risk Mitigation & Contingency

### Risk 1: Freelancer Delivers Poor Quality iOS Setup

**Mitigation:**
- Vet carefully (App Store portfolio required)
- Milestone payments (50% on simulator, 50% on completion)
- 2-week support period in contract
- Budget extra $300 for backup developer if needed

**Contingency:**
- Dispute on Upwork (get partial refund)
- Hire replacement freelancer
- Worst case: DIY with extra 40 hours

**Total Contingency Budget:** $300

---

### Risk 2: Launch Flops (Low Engagement)

**Mitigation:**
- Beta test first (50-100 users validate demand)
- Seed quality content before launch
- Multiple launch channels (not just Product Hunt)
- Templates and research reduce execution risk

**Contingency:**
- Extend marketing timeline (4 more weeks)
- Additional platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, podcasts)
- Direct outreach to philosophy communities
- No additional cash needed (just time)

**Total Contingency Budget:** $0 (time investment)

---

### Risk 3: iOS App Rejected by Apple

**Mitigation:**
- Study App Store guidelines before submit
- Freelancer includes 2-week support for rejections
- Privacy policy compliant
- Content moderation in place

**Contingency:**
- Freelancer fixes technical rejections (covered in contract)
- You handle content/policy issues (usually easy fixes)
- Resubmission timeline: 3-7 days
- Budget extra $200 if need different freelancer

**Total Contingency Budget:** $200

---

### Risk 4: Infrastructure Costs Spike

**Mitigation:**
- Supabase/Vercel free tiers sufficient for 1,000-10,000 users
- Monitor usage weekly
- Optimize queries before scaling
- Alert triggers at 80% of free tier

**Contingency:**
- Supabase Pro: $25/month ($300/year)
- Vercel Pro: $20/month ($240/year)
- Total spike: $540/year (only if rapid growth)

**Total Contingency Budget:** $540 (only if very successful)

---

### Total Contingency Buffer: $1,040

**Recommendation:** Set aside $1,000 for unexpected costs
- Freelancer replacement: $300
- iOS rejection fixes: $200
- Infrastructure scaling: $500
- Total: $1,000
