# COMPETITION FORMATS
## Agent 4: Competitive Gaming Researcher

**Research Question**: What tournament structures and competitive formats work for intellectual debate?

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successful intellectual competitions combine **clear judging criteria**, **fair matching systems**, **varied formats** (quick vs. deep), and **meaningful stakes** (reputation, recognition, prizes). Academic debate tournaments, Chess.com competitions, and eSports structures provide proven models for PhiloDuel's competitive ecosystem.
