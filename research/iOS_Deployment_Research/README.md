# iOS App Store Deployment Research

## Research Scope

This research initiative investigates all viable paths to deploy our Next.js web application to the iOS App Store.

### Current State
- **Stack**: Next.js 15, Vercel hosting, Supabase backend
- **Status**: Fully functional web app, works in mobile Safari
- **Gap**: No native iOS app, not available in App Store

### Key Constraints
- ✅ Current stack must remain intact (Next.js, Vercel, Supabase, GitHub)
- ✅ App works perfectly in mobile browsers
- ❌ Founder is non-technical (needs low-code solutions or clear outsourcing guidance)
- ❌ No existing iOS/mobile codebase
- ❌ No experience with Apple App Store submission process
- ❌ No iOS development environment setup

### Research Objectives

1. **Identify all conversion methods** - PWA, web wrappers, React Native, no-code builders
2. **Deep dive on Capacitor** - Most promising solution for web-to-iOS conversion
3. **Understand App Store requirements** - Apple's guidelines, submission process, timeline
4. **Map technical dependencies** - Mac requirements, certificates, build tools
5. **Evaluate outsourcing options** - Service providers, freelancers, costs
6. **Analyze Next.js compatibility** - Static export requirements, API routes, gotchas
7. **Create cost & timeline models** - Budget scenarios from DIY to full outsourcing

### Success Criteria

By the end of this research, we will have:

- ✅ Complete understanding of ALL paths to iOS App Store
- ✅ Recommended approach optimized for non-technical founder
- ✅ Detailed cost breakdown (one-time + recurring)
- ✅ Realistic timeline estimates
- ✅ Vetted list of service providers and freelancers
- ✅ Technical requirements checklist
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment plan
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans
