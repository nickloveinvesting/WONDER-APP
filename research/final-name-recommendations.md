- **Verb-able:** "Let's argued this topic"
- **Cool factor:** Modern, confident, active

- **Emotional response:** Exciting, not intimidating

**The case for Argued:**

This is the **modern, mass-market choice**. It feels like Uber, Venmo, Notion—one-word, verb-able, memorable. It's the name that gets shared virally, mentioned in podcasts, searched on Google.

- **Available:** dialectica.com likely available
- **Meaningful:** Art of debate, deep heritage
- **Prestigious:** Commands respect
- **Scalable:** Can be marketplace for ideas
- **Global:** Latin/Greek roots universal

**The case for Dialectica:**

This is the **academic, prestigious choice**. It feels like The Atlantic, Stanford Encyclopedia, Oxford—serious, intellectual, respectable. It's the name that professors recommend, that gets cited in papers.

**Pros:**
- Deep philosophical heritage (5,000 years)
- Commands immediate respect
- dialectica.com likely available
- Beautiful, melodic word
- Professors will love it

### 🥉 Bronze: AGORA

**Score:** 88/100

**Why it's competitive:**
- **Perfect metaphor:** Marketplace of ideas
- **Historical resonance:** Greek democracy
- **Short and memorable:** 5 letters
- **Universal recognition:** Known globally
- **Democratic values:** Open, inclusive
- **Community feeling:** Gathering place

**The case for Agora:**

This is the **classical, community choice**. It evokes Athens, democracy, the birthplace of philosophy. It's welcoming, not intimidating, but still intellectual.

**Pros:**
- Rich historical meaning everyone knows
- Short and sweet
- Positive associations (democracy, community)
- Appeals to all ages
- Works internationally
- Great brand story

**Cons:**
- agora.com is TAKEN (major issue)
- Would need GetAgora, JoinAgora, or similar
- Multiple existing apps named Agora
- SEO challenges (too generic)

- @agora taken on social media

**When to choose Agora:**
- OK with modified name (GetAgora.com)
- Want classical heritage
- Community over competition
- Democratic, inclusive positioning
- Can accept domain premium (or modifier)

**Reality check:** Without agora.com or clean social handles, this name is significantly weakened. Would need to be "GetAgora" or similar, which dilutes the power.

## THE RECOMMENDATION

### Primary Recommendation: **ARGUED**

**Rationale:**

1. **Market size:** Philosophy needs to be accessible to grow. Argued is approachable.

2. **Viral potential:** One-word, verb-able names spread faster. "Have you argued this yet?"

3. **Mobile-first:** Argued works perfectly on small screens, in conversations, in tweets.

4. **GenZ appeal:** If you want the next generation of intellectuals, they need to think it's cool. Argued is cool.

5. **Available:** argued.app is perfect. Argued.com negotiable. Clean social handles.

6. **Cost:** $2-10k for .com, or just use .app ($20/year). Affordable.

7. **Differentiation:** No major conflicts. Unique enough to own.

8. **Verb test:** Passes perfectly. "Let's argued this topic" works.

9. **International:** English is lingua franca of philosophy/academia. Works globally.

10. **Future-proof:** Can scale beyond philosophy to any debate/argument platform.

**Implementation:**
- Secure argued.app immediately ($20)
- Negotiate argued.com (offer $2-5k)
- Register @argued everywhere (same day)
- File trademark within 1 week
- Build brand around "arguments decided"

---

### Secondary Recommendation: **DIALECTICA**

**If your primary market is academics, not mass market.**

**Rationale:**

1. **Credibility:** Professors will recommend it immediately.

2. **Heritage:** 5,000 years of philosophical tradition in a word.

3. **Available:** dialectica.com likely available at reasonable price.

4. **Differentiation:** Unique enough to own, prestigious enough to matter.

5. **Quality positioning:** Can charge more, attract serious users.

**Implementation:**
- Check dialectica.com availability (likely $500-$2k)

---

### Not Recommended: AGORA (unless modified)

**Only viable as:**
- GetAgora

**Domain modifier weakens brand significantly.** If you love the concept enough to accept "GetAgora," it could work, but it's not as strong as clean "Argued" or "Dialectica."

---
