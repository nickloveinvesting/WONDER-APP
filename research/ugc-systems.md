# USER-GENERATED CONTENT SYSTEMS
## Agent 6: Content Strategy Researcher

**Research Question**: How do we empower users to create quality philosophical content while maintaining standards?

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The best platforms—Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Reddit, Medium—prove that **user-generated content can exceed professional quality** when proper systems exist. PhiloDuel needs **low barriers to entry** (anyone can contribute), **community quality control** (voting, moderation), **creator incentives** (reputation, recognition, rewards), and **clear contribution pathways** (what can I create, and how?).

**Key Insight**: Users don't just consume content—they ARE the content. Our job is to facilitate, curate, and amplify.

---

## 1. STACK OVERFLOW MODEL: EXPERTISE-DRIVEN Q&A

### **How Stack Overflow Works**

**Core Loop**:
1. User asks philosophical question
2. Community provides answers
3. Votes determine best answer
4. Questioner accepts best answer
5. Reputation earned for quality answers

### **Why It Works**:
- ✅ Fills knowledge gaps (someone always knows)
- ✅ Meritocratic (best answers rise)
- ✅ Self-moderating (downvotes bury bad answers)
- ✅ Searchable (future users benefit)
- ✅ Reputation system (incentivizes quality)

---

### **PhiloDuel Q&A Forum**

#### **Ask Philosophy**
**Categories**:
- Philosophy 101 (beginner questions)
- Specific domains (ethics, logic, metaphysics)
- Contemporary debates (AI ethics, climate change)
- Philosopher-specific (What did Kant mean by...?)
- Homework help (but must show effort)

**Question Quality Requirements**:
- Clear, specific question
- Context provided
- What they've researched already
- Why it matters to them
- Tags for categorization

**Example Good Question**:
```
Title: Is moral relativism self-contradictory?

Body: I've been reading about moral relativism, which says moral truths are relative to cultures. But doesn't the claim "moral truths are relative" itself claim to be universally true? Isn't that contradictory?

What I've read: SEP article on moral relativism, Harman's defense

My confusion: If relativism is true, how can any meta-ethical claim be absolutely true?

Tags: meta-ethics, moral-relativism, logic
```

---

#### **Answer Requirements**

**Quality Standards**:

- Provide reasoning, not just opinion

2. Reasoning (why this answer)
3. Alternative views (other philosophers' positions)
4. Sources (where to learn more)
5. Implications (why it matters)
```

**Voting System**:
- Upvote: Helpful, accurate answer
