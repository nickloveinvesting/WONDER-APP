## Core Values & Beliefs

### 1. **Truth-Seeking & Intellectual Honesty**

**What This Means:**
Philosophy enthusiasts prize **rigorous thinking, logical consistency, and following arguments where they lead**—even when uncomfortable. They value being proven wrong if it leads to better understanding.

**Evidence:**
- Philosophy forums emphasize "uncensored topics where even extremely controversial viewpoints can be presented and argued for" while requiring "stay on-topic and never engage in ad hominems"

**User Quotes:**

> "I'm looking for actual philosophical discussion, not just people confirming my beliefs."

**Application for Product:**
- Content must be intellectually rigorous, not dumbed down
- Present multiple perspectives fairly
- Encourage challenging assumptions
- Fact-checking and source citations matter
- Users will call out logical fallacies and weak arguments

### 2. **Open-Mindedness & Diverse Perspectives**

**What This Means:**
Genuine curiosity about different viewpoints, philosophical traditions, and ways of thinking. Not echo chambers or ideological bubbles.

**Evidence:**
- Big Five personality research: Philosophy majors score **highest on "openness"** trait
- Philosophy forums describe users as "a very diverse crowd of people who share a love for philosophy"
- Interest in both ancient and contemporary philosophy, Eastern and Western traditions

**User Quotes:**

### 3. **Depth Over Breadth**

- Philosophy Tube videos average 20-40 minutes (much longer than typical YouTube)

### 4. **Community & Connection**

- Active participation in Reddit, forums, discussion groups
- Patreon supporters pay more over time as relationships with creators deepen ($3.78 → $8.32)
- Millennials: "Self-help is more about 'we' than 'me'"

- Create sense of belonging to intellectual community
- User-to-user connections, not just user-to-content
- Moderation that maintains quality discourse

### 5. **Personal Growth & Self-Improvement**

**What This Means:**
Philosophy as **practical wisdom for living better**, not just abstract theorizing. Especially strong in younger demographics.

**Evidence:**
- Gen Z and Millennials turning to **Stoicism for mental health** and resilience
- "Stoicism provides a framework for dealing with difficult emotions and situations in a healthy way"
- Philosophy app users seek "meaning-making during formative years"
- Interest in applied philosophy (ethics, well-being, decision-making)

**User Quotes:**
> "As a Gen Z growing up in times of constant turbulence including the pandemic and cost of living crisis, stoic philosophy has provided solace and mental clarity."

> "I don't just want to understand philosophy—I want to use it to live better."

**Application for Product:**
- Balance theoretical and practical philosophy
- Show real-world applications
- Connect ancient wisdom to modern life
- Mental health and well-being angles (without being self-help-y)

**Evidence:**
- "Being a self-learner in philosophy is actually considered an advantage by some"
- Strong autodidact community
- Philosophy forums welcome "everyone, from high school students to philosophy professors"
- Resistance to academic gatekeeping

**User Quotes:**
