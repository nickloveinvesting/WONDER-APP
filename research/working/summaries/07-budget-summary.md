## Key Financial Decisions

- Learning pays dividends later
- Save $4-6K for marketing/iOS
- Can always hire later if stuck

### Decision 2: Timing of iOS Deployment
**Recommendation:** Web-first

- iOS follows 1-2 months later (Month 7-8)
- Validate demand before iOS investment
- Faster initial launch
- Lower risk

### Decision 3: Marketing Budget Allocation
**Recommendation:** 90% organic, 10% paid tests
- Spend most time on organic (Reddit, HN, forums)
- $50-100 tests on Reddit ads, philosophy podcasts
- Optimize organic first, scale paid later
- Philosophy community responds well to organic
