## Problem-First Hooks

### Hook 1: The Dying Discussion
"Philosophy discussions online have a fatal flaw: they die. Someone asks a deep question on Reddit, gets 3 replies, then silence. Discord debates get buried under memes. Forums are graveyards of half-finished thoughts."

**Platform**: Reddit, Medium
**Emotional trigger**: Frustration
**Follow-up**: "I built ARGUED to fix this."

---

### Hook 2: The Accessibility Barrier
"Want to discuss philosophy online? You have three options: gatekept academic forums, chaotic Discord servers, or Reddit threads that die after three replies. None of them work."

**Platform**: Reddit, Twitter, Product Hunt
**Emotional trigger**: Frustration with limited options
**Follow-up**: Solution introduction

---

### Hook 3: The Gatekeeping Problem
"Philosophy has a gatekeeping problem. Try to discuss Kant on an academic forum and you get: 'Read the primary sources first.' Try Reddit and discussions die. Try Discord and everything gets lost in chat chaos."

**Platform**: Reddit (r/philosophy), Medium
**Emotional trigger**: Frustration with elitism
**Follow-up**: "There has to be a better way."

---

### Hook 4: The Platform Failure
"Every philosophy platform fails in the same way. Forums become ghost towns. Discord conversations vanish in 10 minutes. Reddit threads get buried. And academic platforms require credentials just to comment."

**Platform**: Hacker News, Medium
**Emotional trigger**: Systemic failure recognition
**Follow-up**: "I analyzed why this happens."

---

### Hook 5: The Lost Debate
"Ever had a great philosophical debate in Discord, then tried to find it three days later? It's gone. Buried under 10,000 messages about someone's lunch. This is why philosophy discussions online are broken."

**Platform**: Reddit, Discord communities
**Emotional trigger**: Relatable frustration
**Follow-up**: "Persistence matters."

---

### Hook 6: The False Choice
"Want to debate philosophy online? Pick your poison: Academic gatekeeping, Reddit chaos, Discord ephemerality, or Twitter hostility. Why isn't there a platform that actually works?"

**Platform**: Twitter, Reddit
**Emotional trigger**: Frustration with inadequate options
**Follow-up**: "I built one."

---

### Hook 7: The Abandoned Thread
"You spend an hour crafting a thoughtful reply to a philosophy discussion. You post it. Two days later: zero replies. The discussion died while you were writing. This happens constantly."

**Platform**: Reddit (very relatable), Medium
**Emotional trigger**: Wasted effort frustration
**Follow-up**: "Conversations shouldn't work this way."

---

### Hook 8: The Credential Trap
"Most philosophy platforms require academic credentials to participate meaningfully. But curiosity doesn't need a PhD. Interest doesn't require peer review. Good arguments stand on their own."

**Platform**: Reddit, Medium, Product Hunt
**Emotional trigger**: Anti-elitism
**Follow-up**: "Philosophy should be accessible."

---

### Hook 9: The Modern Philosophy Paradox
"We live in the age of instant global communication, yet it's harder than ever to have a sustained philosophical discussion. Forums are dead. Discord is chaos. Twitter is hostile. Academic platforms are gatekept."

**Platform**: Medium, LinkedIn, Hacker News
**Emotional trigger**: Ironic observation
**Follow-up**: "Technology made it worse."

---

### Hook 10: The Search Frustration
"Try searching for where philosophy happens online. You'll find: Dead forums from 2010. Academic paywalls. Discord servers with 10,000 members but zero structure. Reddit threads that died mid-argument."

**Platform**: Reddit, Twitter
**Emotional trigger**: Failed search = validation
**Follow-up**: "I searched for years."

---

### Hook 11: The Format Mismatch
"Twitter is too short for philosophy. Reddit threads are too unstructured. Discord is too chaotic. Academic journals are too gatekept. None of these formats were built for philosophical discourse."

**Platform**: Hacker News, Medium
**Emotional trigger**: Recognition of systemic mismatch
**Follow-up**: "Format shapes discourse."

---

### Hook 12: The Lonely Philosopher
"You love philosophy but have no one to discuss it with. Online options? Dead forums, gatekept academics, or Reddit threads that ghost you. Philosophy deserves better infrastructure."

**Platform**: Reddit (very relatable), Discord
**Emotional trigger**: Loneliness, isolation
**Follow-up**: "You're not alone."

---

## Story-Based Hooks

**Follow-up**: Data insights

---

**Emotional trigger**: Wasted time realization
**Follow-up**: "Structure matters."

**Follow-up**: "Maybe you've been searching too."

---
