# Conversation Topics Taxonomy
## Topic & Content Strategy for Philosophical Dialogue

**Research Date:** November 14, 2025
**Focus:** What types of philosophical questions generate the best conversations (not debates)

---

## Executive Summary

This research identifies the types of philosophical content that drive meaningful dialogue rather than competitive debate. Our analysis of successful philosophy platforms (Philosophize This!, Hi-Phi Nation, r/philosophy, Ethics Unwrapped, Very Short Introductions) reveals that the best conversations emerge from:

1. **Open-ended questions without clear "correct" answers** that invite exploration rather than argumentation
2. **Real-world scenarios and case studies** that ground abstract concepts in lived experience
3. **Contemporary issues with philosophical dimensions** (AI ethics, climate philosophy, digital rights) that feel personally relevant
4. **Accessible entry points** that welcome beginners while maintaining intellectual depth
5. **Questions that prioritize "how should we think about this?" over "who is right?"**

**Key Insight:** The distinction between dialogue and debate is structural, not topical. ANY philosophical topic can spark dialogue if framed collaboratively ("let's explore together") rather than competitively ("let's argue positions"). The format and framing matter more than the subject matter.

## Topic Categories That Spark Dialogue

### 1. Applied Ethics & Moral Dilemmas

**Why They Work:** These questions connect philosophy to lived experience, making abstract concepts tangible. They invite multiple valid perspectives rather than single "correct" answers.

#### Subcategories:

**A. Classic Thought Experiments**
- **Trolley Problem variants** - The foundational ethics thought experiment developed by Philippa Foot (1967) and adapted by Judith Jarvis Thomson (1985). Explores utilitarian vs. deontological ethics through scenarios where sacrificing one person could save many.
- **Lifeboat scenarios** - Resource allocation under extreme constraints
- **Moral luck** - When outcomes beyond our control affect moral judgments
- **Principle of double effect** - Intended vs. foreseen consequences

**Example Prompts:**
- "A self-driving car must choose between swerving into a pedestrian or staying course and injuring passengers. How should it be programmed to decide?"
- "Is it more ethical to actively cause a smaller harm or passively allow a greater harm?"

**B. Contemporary Moral Questions**
- **AI and automation ethics** - Job displacement, algorithmic bias, autonomous weapons
- **Climate responsibility** - Individual vs. collective action, intergenerational justice
- **Digital privacy and surveillance** - Balancing security and freedom
- **Genetic engineering** - Designer babies, enhancement vs. therapy
- **Animal rights and welfare** - Factory farming, conservation, species protection
- **Economic justice** - Wealth inequality, universal basic income, reparations

**Example Prompts:**
- "If individual actions have negligible climate impact, can we be held morally responsible?" (Based on Nevin Chellappah's work on collective action)
- "Should AI systems have rights if they become conscious? How would we know?"
- "Is it ethical to extend human lifespan indefinitely if it increases inequality?"

**Engagement Drivers:**
- Personal stakes (everyone has encountered these issues)
- No clear consensus (invites genuine exploration)
- Multiple valid frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics)
- Real-world applications (not purely abstract)

## Contemporary vs. Classic Topics Balance

### The Integration Model (Recommended)

Rather than separating contemporary and classic topics, **integrate them** to show philosophy's enduring relevance and historical depth.

**Example Integrations:**

**Contemporary Issue → Classic Philosophy Connection**
- **AI consciousness** ↔ Descartes' mind-body dualism, Turing test
- **Climate justice** ↔ Rawls' original position, intergenerational ethics
- **Social media authenticity** ↔ Heidegger's das Man, Sartre's bad faith
- **Algorithmic bias** ↔ Kant's categorical imperative, Mill's harm principle
- **Digital privacy** ↔ Mill's liberty, Foucault's surveillance

**Benefits:**
- Shows philosophy isn't just historical trivia
- Provides conceptual tools for contemporary issues
- Adds depth to current debates
- Makes classics feel relevant to modern life

---

### Content Mix Recommendations

**Weekly Balance (7 prompts per week):**
- **3 Contemporary issues** (AI, climate, technology, current events)
- **2 Applied ethics** (moral dilemmas, case studies)
- **1 Existential/personal** (meaning, death, identity)
- **1 Classic philosophy** (framed accessibly with modern relevance)

**Monthly Thematic Arcs:**
Rotate focus areas monthly while maintaining variety:
- **Week 1:** AI & Technology Ethics
- **Week 2:** Meaning & Existential Questions
- **Week 3:** Social & Political Philosophy
- **Week 4:** Classic Philosophy Made Relevant

**Seasonal Considerations:**

## Conclusion

The most effective philosophical conversation topics share common characteristics:

1. **Open-ended without single "correct" answers**
2. **Personally relevant to participants' lives**
3. **Balance concrete scenarios with abstract concepts**
4. **Welcome multiple legitimate perspectives**
5. **Frame as collaborative exploration, not competitive debate**

Success depends less on choosing the "right" topics than on **framing them dialogically** and **scaffolding progressive engagement**. Any philosophical question can spark meaningful conversation if presented as an invitation to think together rather than an opportunity to prove positions.

The platform should emphasize **contemporary relevance with historical depth**, **accessible entry with intellectual substance**, and **personal connection to abstract ideas**. By rotating categories, balancing difficulty levels, and integrating user contributions, the platform can serve beginners and experts alike in genuine philosophical dialogue.
