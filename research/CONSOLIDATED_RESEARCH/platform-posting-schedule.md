## Platform-Specific Posting Strategy

### Product Hunt

#### Launch Post Details
**When**: Tuesday, 12:01 AM PST (Wednesday technically, but PH days start at midnight PST)
**Why This Time**:
- PH resets at midnight PST
- Gives you full 24 hours to accumulate upvotes
- Early posts have advantage in ranking algorithm

**Why Tuesday (or Wed/Thu)**:
- Tue-Thu are highest traffic days
- Avoid Mon (people catching up from weekend)
- Avoid Fri (lower engagement heading into weekend)
- Weekends get buried quickly

#### Post Components
```
Tagline: "A platform for people who miss thoughtful online discourse"

Description:
ARGUED is where you go when you actually want to change your mind, not just win an argument.

We're building the antidote to Twitter dunks and Reddit hivemind...

[Full description with features, benefits, what makes it different]

Topics: Social Media, Philosophy, Community, Discussion, Debate

Link: https://argued.app (or your domain)
```

#### First Comment (Post Immediately)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built ARGUED because I was tired of online conversations that generate more heat than light.

After watching my favorite communities descend into echo chambers, I wanted to create
a space where:
- Changing your mind is celebrated, not mocked
- Arguments are structured, not just threaded chaos
- Quality discourse beats viral dunks

We've been in beta for 2 weeks with ~100 users and have had genuinely great debates
about AI consciousness, free will, effective altruism, and more.

I'd love your feedback! What do you think makes for good online discourse?
```

#### Engagement Schedule
- **12:01 AM - 8:00 AM**: Respond to any early comments within 30 minutes
- **8:00 AM - 8:00 PM**: Respond to ALL comments within 10-15 minutes (critical period)
- **8:00 PM - 11:59 PM**: Respond within 30 minutes
- **Throughout**: Thank upvoters in comments, engage authentically

#### Follow-Up Posts
- **Day 2 (Wednesday)**: Update with launch day stats in comments
- **Day 7 (Next Tuesday)**: Post "One week update" in comments
- **Never**: Don't ask for upvotes directly (against rules)

---

### Hacker News

#### Launch Post Details
**When**: Tuesday, 8:00 AM PST (11:00 AM EST)
**Why This Time**:
- Catches East Coast lunch break (11 AM EST)
- West Coast morning coffee time (8 AM PST)
- High HN traffic period
- Not too early (gets buried by afternoon posts)
- Alternative: Sunday 6:00 AM UTC (less competition, but less traffic)

**Title Format**: "Show HN: ARGUED – A platform for thoughtful philosophical discourse"
- Keep under 80 characters
- "Show HN:" prefix is required
- Descriptive but not salesy
- Dash (–) vs dash (-) matters for typography nerds

#### First Comment (CRITICAL - Post Within 1 Minute)
```
Hey HN! I'm [YourName], creator of ARGUED.

I built this because I missed the old internet where people actually engaged with
ideas instead of just dunking on each other. After watching my favorite Reddit
communities descend into groupthink and Twitter become increasingly hostile, I
wanted to create a space optimized for changing your mind, not just winning arguments.

Technical stack: [Mention if interesting - e.g., "Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL,
deployed on Vercel. Open to questions about the architecture."]

We've been in beta for 2 weeks with ~100 users and have had genuinely thoughtful
debates about AI safety, free will, and political philosophy.

What I'm most curious about: the voting mechanism. Instead of up/down votes, we
let people mark arguments as "changed my mind" or "made me think." Would love HN's
feedback on this approach.

Happy to answer any questions about the technical implementation, moderation
strategy, or philosophy behind the platform!
```

#### Engagement Strategy
- **First 2 hours**: Respond to EVERY comment within 5-10 minutes (make or break period)
- **Hours 2-4**: Respond within 15 minutes
- **Hours 4-8**: Respond within 30 minutes
- **After 8 hours**: Respond within 1-2 hours

#### Response Tone for HN
- Technical and thoughtful
- Acknowledge criticisms openly
- Don't be defensive
- Show, don't tell (link to good examples)
- Admit what you don't know
- Discuss tradeoffs honestly

#### What NOT to Do
- Don't ask people to upvote
- Don't link to your HN post elsewhere (against guidelines)
- Don't vote manipulate
- Don't be salesy or promotional
- Don't ignore tough questions

#### Follow-Up Posts (If Appropriate)
- **Week 4**: Post interesting technical deep-dive (not as Show HN)
  - "What we learned building a real-time debate platform"
  - "How we moderate philosophical discussions without killing discourse"
- **Month 3**: Share interesting data/insights
  - "Analysis: What philosophical topics get the most 'changed my mind' votes"

---

### Reddit

#### Core Principle: Don't Be Spammy
- **NEVER** post same content to multiple subreddits on same day
- **ALWAYS** read subreddit rules carefully
- **ALWAYS** customize post for each community
- **Build karma first** by genuinely engaging in communities

#### Posting Schedule

##### Day 0 (Tuesday) - 12:00 PM PST
**Subreddit**: r/SideProject
**Why First**: Explicitly for showing side projects, most welcoming
**Why This Time**: 12 PM PST = 3 PM EST (East Coast post-lunch browse, West Coast lunch)

**Post Title**: "I built a platform for philosophical debates after getting tired of Reddit arguments going nowhere [Show & Tell]"

**Post Format**:
```
**The Problem**: I love discussing big ideas on Reddit, but discussions often
devolve into:
- Downvoting disagreement instead of engaging
- Strawman arguments and bad faith interpretations
- Echo chambers where contrarian views get buried
- No structure to track complex debates

**What I Built**: ARGUED - a platform for structured philosophical discourse where:
[3-4 bullet points of key features]

**Tech Stack**: [Brief mention - Redditors care about this]

**Beta Results**: 2 weeks, ~100 users, some genuinely great debates

**Lessons Learned**:
1. [Interesting learning]
2. [Challenge you faced]
3. [Surprising insight]

Would love feedback from the r/SideProject community!

[Link in comments or bio, depending on subreddit rules]
```

##### Day 0 (Tuesday) - 3:00 PM PST (IF FIRST POST WENT WELL)
**Subreddit**: r/InternetIsBeautiful

**Post Title**: "A debate platform where changing your mind is celebrated, not mocked"

##### Day 1 (Wednesday) - 11:00 AM PST

**WARNING**: Very strict moderation, may require pre-approval
**Strategy**: Message mods first, ask if appropriate to share
**Tone**: Academic, serious, focus on philosophical value
**Post Title**: "A new platform for structured philosophical discourse [Meta/Community]"

##### Day 2 (Thursday) - 12:00 PM PST
**Subreddit**: r/TrueReddit OR r/DepthHub
**Why**: Meta-Reddit communities that appreciate quality discourse
**Post Title**: "I built an alternative to Reddit for people who actually want to engage with ideas"
**Angle**: Criticism of Reddit's flaws, present ARGUED as solution

##### Day 3 (Friday) - 1:00 PM PST
**Subreddit**: r/Startup_Ideas OR r/AlphaandBetausers

**Tuesday**: r/EffectiveAltruism (if relevant content)
**Wednesday**: r/RationalArguments
**Thursday**: r/ChangeMyView (engage, don't promote)
**Friday**: r/PhilosophyMemes (lighter content, if appropriate)

#### Reddit Engagement Rules
- **Response time**: Within 1 hour for first 4 hours
- **Engagement depth**: Thoughtful responses, not just "Thanks!"
- **Criticism handling**: Acknowledge valid points, don't be defensive
- **Link strategy**: Some subs require link in comments, not post
- **Follow-up**: Check back at 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours

#### Spacing Strategy
- **Minimum 3 hours** between posts to different subreddits
- **Ideally 24 hours** between posts to different subreddits
- **Wait 1 week** before posting to similar subreddits (e.g., r/philosophy and r/Stoicism)
- **Never** cross-post using Reddit's crosspost feature for promotional content

### Twitter/X

#### Launch Day Thread (Tuesday, 6:15 AM PST)
**Why This Time**: After Product Hunt launch (3+ hours to accumulate some activity), before HN launch

**Thread Structure** (7-8 tweets):
```
🧵 1/
After 6 months of building and 2 weeks of beta testing, today we're launching ARGUED.

It's a platform for people who miss thoughtful discourse online.

Here's why I built it (and why I think you might care):

---

2/
The problem: Online discourse has become about winning, not learning.

Twitter rewards dunks. Reddit rewards hivemind. Forums reward volume.

Nobody rewards "I changed my mind" or "That's a good point I hadn't considered."

---

3/
[Screenshot of a great debate from beta]

This is what good-faith argument looks like.

Two people genuinely engaging with ideas, not just performing for an audience.

---

4/
ARGUED is built differently:

✅ Structured argument threading
✅ "Changed my mind" > upvotes
✅ Quality over virality
✅ Long-form thinking encouraged
✅ Nuance rewarded, not punished

---

5/
We've been in beta for 2 weeks with ~100 thoughtful humans.

Topics so far: AI consciousness, free will, effective altruism, political philosophy, ethics of eating meat

Every debate has taught me something new.

---

6/
We're launching on Product Hunt today: [link]

If you miss the old internet where people actually listened to each other,
I'd love your support (and honest feedback).

---

7/
To the beta testers who helped us get here: thank you 🙏

To everyone else: would love to hear what you think.

What do YOU think makes for good online discourse?

[Link to ARGUED]
```

#### Ongoing Twitter Strategy
- **Daily**: Share interesting debate moments (with permission)
- **2-3x/week**: Philosophical questions to drive engagement
- **Weekly**: Metrics/progress updates
- **Engage**: Reply to anyone mentioning ARGUED within 1 hour

#### Twitter Best Times (General)
- **Weekdays**: 9 AM - 11 AM PST, 1 PM - 3 PM PST
- **Avoid**: Late night, very early morning, weekends (unless topical)

---

### LinkedIn

#### Launch Post (Tuesday, 6:30 AM PST)
**Tone**: Professional, reflective on journey
**Length**: Longer than Twitter, shorter than blog post

**Structure**:
```
I just launched something I've been building for 6 months: a platform for
thoughtful philosophical discourse.

Here's what I learned about building a product for quality over quantity:

[3-4 key insights from the journey]

The thing that surprised me most: [Interesting learning]

We're live today, and I'd love feedback from this community.

#ProductLaunch #Philosophy #CommunityBuilding
```

#### LinkedIn Follow-Up
- **Week 1**: Share launch day results
- **Week 2**: Share interesting user story
- **Week 3**: Share technical challenge overcome
- **Monthly**: Strategic reflection on building in public

---

### Discord Servers

#### Strategy: Engage, Don't Spam
**Identify Relevant Servers**:
- Philosophy discussion servers
- Debate community servers
- Indie hacker / maker servers
- Communities you're already active in

#### Posting Rules
- **Only post** in #self-promotion or #show-and-tell channels
- **Only in servers** where you're an active member (not drive-by spam)
- **Customize** message for each community
- **Ask first** if unsure if appropriate

#### Timing
- **Launch day**: Mention in 2-3 servers you're active in
- **Week 1**: Mention in 3-5 more relevant servers
- **Ongoing**: Only when genuinely relevant to conversation

---

### Forums & Communities

#### Philosophy Forums
**Platforms**:
- Philosophy Stack Exchange
- Philosophy Now forums
- Stoicism subreddit/forums
- Effective Altruism forum

**Strategy**: Value-first
- Engage genuinely for 1-2 weeks before mentioning ARGUED
- Only mention when relevant to discussion
- Position as "I built this to solve exactly this problem we're discussing"

**Timing**: Week 1-2, staggered across different forums

---

### Blog/Medium

#### Publishing Schedule
**Week 0 (Pre-launch)**: "Why I'm building ARGUED"
**Week 1**: "What we learned from our first 100 debates"
**Week 2**: "How we moderate philosophical discussions"
**Week 4**: "One month in: metrics and learnings"
**Month 2**: "The philosophy of online discourse" (deeper think piece)

#### Cross-Posting Strategy
- Publish on own blog first (SEO ownership)
- Cross-post to Medium (distribution)
- Cross-post to dev.to if technical angle
- Share on relevant subreddits (r/TrueReddit, etc.)
- Share on HN if interesting technical/philosophical angle

## Timing Principles

### Best Times to Post by Platform

**Product Hunt**:
- 12:01 AM PST (start of PH day)
- Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
- Avoid Monday, Friday, weekends

**Hacker News**:
- 8:00-9:00 AM PST (11 AM - 12 PM EST)
- Early in week (Mon-Wed best)
- Alternative: Sunday 6:00 AM UTC (less competition)
- Avoid: Friday afternoon, weekends

**Reddit**:
- 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM PST (2-4 PM EST)
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday best
- Avoid: Very early morning, late night
- Each subreddit has own patterns

**Twitter**:
- 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM PST
- 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM PST
- Weekdays better than weekends
- Avoid: Late night, very early morning

**LinkedIn**:
- 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM PST (business hours starting)
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Avoid: Weekends

### Spacing Rules

**Between platforms (same day)**:
- ✅ Product Hunt → (6 hrs) → Twitter → (2 hrs) → HN → (4 hrs) → Reddit
- This looks like coordinated launch, not spam

**Between similar platforms**:
- Reddit to Reddit: Minimum 3 hours, ideally 24 hours
- Forum to Forum: Minimum 24 hours
- Blog post shares: Can share same day to different platforms

**Follow-up posts**:
- Same platform: Wait 1 week minimum (unless comment/update)
- Related content: Wait 2-3 days

---

## Platform Dependencies & Sequencing

### Launch Day Sequencing Logic

1. **Product Hunt first** (12:01 AM)
   - Why: Needs full 24 hours, rankings reset at midnight
   - Doesn't depend on anything else

2. **Twitter second** (6:15 AM)
   - Why: Can mention "just launched on PH" (social proof)
   - Depends on: PH being live

3. **Hacker News third** (8:00 AM)
   - Why: Optimal HN time, can mention PH launch
   - Depends on: PH having some initial traction

4. **Reddit fourth** (12:00 PM)
   - Why: Can show social proof from PH + HN
   - Depends on: Having activity to point to

### Why This Sequence Works
- Each post has more social proof than the last
- Timing optimizes for each platform's peak
- Doesn't look desperate (spaced throughout day)
- Allows you to engage thoughtfully with each
- Creates momentum narrative

---

## Anti-Spam Strategies

### How to Avoid Looking Spammy

**DO**:
- ✅ Customize every post for the community
- ✅ Engage authentically with comments
- ✅ Space posts across multiple days
- ✅ Build karma/reputation first
- ✅ Add value, not just links
- ✅ Follow all community rules

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Copy-paste same content everywhere
- ❌ Post to 10 subreddits in one day
- ❌ Drop links without context
- ❌ Ignore comments on your posts
- ❌ Use brand new accounts
- ❌ Ask for upvotes/engagement

### Red Flags That Trigger Spam Detection
- Same text posted multiple places
- Multiple posts in short timeframe
- No engagement with own posts
- Brand new account posting links
- Post and disappear
- Only promotional content (never contribute)

### How to Build Trust
- Engage in communities for weeks before posting
- Comment on others' posts genuinely
- Build karma organically
- Use established account (not brand new)
- Show, don't tell
- Be transparent about being the creator

---

## Contingency Plans

### If You Can't Be Online All Day Tuesday
- **Solution 1**: Delay launch to when you can be fully available
- **Solution 2**: Recruit 2-3 beta users to help monitor and respond
- **Solution 3**: Use scheduling tools for initial posts, but BE THERE for engagement
- **Not Recommended**: Launch and hope for the best (engagement is critical)

### If Multiple Platforms Spike at Once
- **Priority Order**: HN > Product Hunt > Reddit > Twitter
- **Why**: HN has shortest "hot" window, most critical to ride momentum
- **Delegate**: Have someone else monitor Twitter if possible

### If Something Goes Wrong
- **Server down**: Fix immediately, post update, be transparent
- **Negative feedback**: Respond thoughtfully, don't be defensive
- **Rules violation**: Apologize, correct, learn
- **Nobody cares**: Don't panic, focus on platforms that ARE working

---
