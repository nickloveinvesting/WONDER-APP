# Reddit Posting Guidelines & Best Practices

Comprehensive do's and don'ts for promoting ARGUED on Reddit without getting flagged as spam, banned, or downvoted into oblivion.

---

## Core Philosophy: Add Value First, Promote Second

**Reddit's Golden Rule**: Redditors can smell marketing from a mile away. The platform punishes sales pitches and rewards authentic contribution.

**The 90/10 Evolution (2025 Update)**:
- **Old Rule**: 90% regular content, 10% self-promotion
- **New Reality**: It's not about ratio; it's about context
- **Best Practice**: Become a recognized, helpful member BEFORE promoting

**Translation for ARGUED**: Spend 2-4 weeks contributing to philosophy and startup subreddits before mentioning your platform.

## Pre-Launch Requirements

### Account Preparation (Critical)

#### 1. Build Karma FIRST
**Minimum Requirements**:
- **200-300 total karma** before ANY promotion
- Mix of post karma and comment karma
- Earned organically over 2-4 weeks

**How to Build Karma**:
- Comment thoughtfully on r/askphilosophy questions
- Share insights in r/Stoicism discussions
- Help others in r/learnphilosophy
- Participate in r/changemyview debates
- Answer questions in r/startups

**Why This Matters**:
- New accounts with zero karma trigger spam filters
- AutoModerator often auto-removes low-karma posts
- Users check post history; 100% promotion = instant downvotes
- Credibility requires demonstrated community participation

---

#### 2. Account Age Requirements
**Minimum**: 7-14 days old (varies by subreddit)
- r/SideProject: Usually allows newer accounts
- r/philosophy: May require 30+ days
- r/startups: Typically 7+ days

**Best Practice**: Create account 30 days before launch, build karma immediately

---

#### 3. Establish Posting History
**Goal**: Show you're a real person, not a spam bot

**Recommended Activity Pattern** (weeks 1-4 before launch):
- **Week 1**: 10-15 comments on philosophy discussions
- **Week 2**: 8-12 comments on startup/tech threads
- **Week 3**: 5-7 comments + 1-2 question posts
- **Week 4**: Maintain engagement, prepare launch post

**What to Post/Comment**:
- Thoughtful answers to philosophy questions
- Helpful advice on other people's projects
- Genuine questions about philosophical topics
- Insights on startup challenges
- Feedback on others' launches

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Account created yesterday, promoting today
- ❌ Zero comment history before promotional post
- ❌ Every post is about your own project
- ❌ Copy-paste responses
- ❌ Obvious alt account

---

## Subreddit-Specific Guidelines

## General Reddit Etiquette

### The Karma System: How It Really Works

**What Karma Measures**:
- Community trust and participation
- Content quality (via upvotes/downvotes)
- Account legitimacy (bots have low karma)

**How to Earn Karma Legitimately**:
1. **Comment Karma** (easier to build):
   - Thoughtful comments on popular posts
   - Helpful answers to questions
   - Early engagement (first 2 hours of post)
   - Relevant insights, not generic responses

2. **Post Karma** (harder but more valuable):
   - Original questions that spark discussion
   - Valuable resources shared
   - Content that provides clear value
   - Well-timed posts (see schedule guide)

**How to Lose Karma Fast**:
- Self-promotion without value
- Arguing with users
- Ignoring subreddit rules
- Copy-paste responses
- Being defensive or hostile

---

### Engagement Best Practices

#### 1. Timing: First 2 Hours Are Critical

**Why**: Reddit's algorithm heavily weights early engagement
**What This Means**:
- Be available for 2 hours after posting
- Respond to every comment
- Upvote good questions
- Award helpful feedback

**Time Management**:
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM Eastern (optimal engagement)
- Block off 2-3 hours post-publication
- Set phone notifications for replies
- Have demo links ready to share

---

#### 2. Response Guidelines

**To Positive Feedback**:
```
✅ "Thank you! Appreciate the kind words. What feature would be most useful for you?"
✅ "This made my day - thanks for trying it out! Any rough edges I should know about?"
❌ "Thanks!" (too brief, ends conversation)
❌ "Glad you like it! Buy premium!" (too promotional)
```

**To Critical Feedback**:
```
✅ "Great point - I hadn't considered that angle. Would [solution] address your concern?"
✅ "You're right, that's not working well. We're rethinking it. What would you suggest?"
❌ "That's not a bug, it's a feature" (defensive)
❌ "You don't understand the use case" (dismissive)
```

**To Questions**:
```
✅ "Good question! Currently it works like [X], but we're exploring [Y]. Would that help?"
✅ "Let me explain the thinking: [reasoning]. Does that make sense or miss the point?"
❌ "It's explained on the website" (lazy)
❌ "Coming soon!" (vague)
```

**To Trolls**:
```
✅ "Appreciate the feedback!" (brief, professional, move on)
✅ [No response - don't feed trolls]
❌ Long defensive explanation
❌ Counter-attacking or arguing
```

---

#### 3. The Edit Protocol

**When to Edit Your Post**:
- Fixing typos (mark as "Edit: typo")
- Adding demo link if requested
- Updating based on feedback
- Clarifying misunderstandings

**How to Mark Edits**:
```
Edit: Fixed typo
Edit: Added demo link as requested
Edit: Clarified - this is still in beta, not production
```

**What NOT to Edit**:
- Removing content after criticism
- Changing core message after backlash
- Deleting negative feedback responses
- Sneaky promotional additions

---

### The Self-Promotion Ratio

**2025 Best Practice**: 1 promotional post per 10+ value-adding contributions

**What Counts as Value-Adding**:
- Thoughtful comment on someone else's post
- Helpful answer to a question
- Useful resource shared
- Constructive feedback on someone's project
- Participation in discussion

**What Counts as Promotional**:
- Post about your platform
- Comment mentioning your tool
- Response including link to your site
- Even subtle brand mentions

**Example Good Ratio** (Month 1):
- 40 helpful comments on r/askphilosophy
- 15 feedback comments on r/SideProject posts
- 10 insights shared on r/Stoicism
- 5 questions posted on r/TrueAskReddit
- **1 launch post on r/SideProject**

---

### Cross-Posting Rules

**DO**:
- ✅ Customize message for each subreddit
- ✅ Space posts across different days
- ✅ Respect each community's culture
- ✅ Engage separately in each thread

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Post identical content to 10 subreddits in 10 minutes
- ❌ Use "crossposted from" (makes it obvious spam)
- ❌ Ignore comments on one while responding to another
- ❌ Exceed 3-4 subreddits in a single week

**Recommended Spacing**:
- Day 1: r/SideProject
- Day 3: r/AlphaandBetausers
- Week 2: r/startups Weekly Feedback thread
- Week 3: Organic participation only (no new promotional posts)

---

### Link Sharing Etiquette

**DO**:
- ✅ Share link when asked
- ✅ Use clean URLs (no tracking parameters that look spammy)
- ✅ Provide context with link
- ✅ Offer text description for those who can't click

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Lead with link in post
- ❌ Use URL shorteners (looks sketchy)
- ❌ Include UTM parameters excessively
- ❌ Link without permission in comments

**Format**:
```
✅ "Happy to share a demo - [your URL]. Still in beta so expect rough edges!"
✅ "Link in my profile if you want to check it out. No pressure!"
❌ "CLICK HERE NOW: bit.ly/xyz123"
❌ "yoursite.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=spam"
```

---

## Spam Prevention: Stay Off Reddit's Radar

### Reddit's Spam Detection

**Automatic Flags**:
- New account + immediate promotion
- Same message posted to multiple subreddits
- High link-to-comment ratio
- URL shorteners
- Excessive self-links
- Rapid posting frequency

**Moderator Flags**:
- User reports of spam
- Violation of subreddit rules
- Promotional content in no-promotion zones
- Fake organic mentions

**Consequences**:
- Post removal (AutoModerator)
- Shadowban (posts invisible to others)
- Subreddit ban (can't post/comment)
- Site-wide ban (account terminated)

---

### How to Stay Safe

#### 1. The 48-Hour Rule
- Wait 48 hours between promotional posts (even to different subreddits)
- Exception: Customized posts to completely different communities

#### 2. The Participation Rule
- For every 1 promotional post, make 10+ helpful contributions
- Contribute to subreddit BEFORE promoting there
- Build community history (weeks, not hours)

#### 3. The Authenticity Rule
- Actually use Reddit as a Redditor
- Participate in topics unrelated to your business
- Have genuine interests beyond promotion
- Don't treat account as purely marketing tool

#### 4. The Transparency Rule
- Always disclose you built the thing
- Don't pretend to be unbiased third party
- Admit affiliations clearly
- Mark sponsored content if applicable

---

### Red Flags to Avoid

**Account Red Flags**:
- ❌ Created today, promoting today
- ❌ Only activity is self-promotion
- ❌ Username matches product name
- ❌ No comments, only posts
- ❌ Post history is all links to same domain

**Content Red Flags**:
- ❌ Same post to 15 subreddits
- ❌ Generic "check out my app" title
- ❌ No engagement with commenters
- ❌ Overly promotional language
- ❌ Ignoring subreddit rules

**Behavior Red Flags**:
- ❌ Arguing with users who criticize
- ❌ Deleting posts that didn't perform
- ❌ Vote manipulation (asking friends to upvote)
- ❌ Using alt accounts to promote
- ❌ Defensive or hostile responses

---

## Handling Negative Feedback

### Types of Criticism

**1. Constructive Criticism**
- **Example**: "The UI is confusing - couldn't figure out how to start a discussion"
- **Response**: Thank them, acknowledge issue, ask for specifics, commit to improvement
- **Template**: "You're absolutely right - onboarding needs work. Was it [specific element] that was unclear? We're redesigning it based on this feedback."

**2. Legitimate Concerns**
- **Example**: "How is this different from [competitor]?"
- **Response**: Honest comparison, acknowledge similarities, explain unique angle
- **Template**: "Great question! [Competitor] does X really well. We focus on Y because [reasoning]. Different approaches for different needs."

**3. Feature Requests**
- **Example**: "Would be useful if it had [feature]"
- **Response**: Thank them, explain roadmap, ask for use case
- **Template**: "Love this idea! We've been considering [feature]. How would you use it? Helps us prioritize."

**4. Trolling**
- **Example**: "This is garbage, nobody will use this"
- **Response**: Brief professional response, or none
- **Template**: "Appreciate the feedback!" [then move on]

---

### What NOT to Do

**❌ Get Defensive**:
Bad: "You clearly don't understand what we're trying to do"
Good: "I may not have explained it well - let me try again"

**❌ Argue**:
Bad: "That's not a problem for our target users"
Good: "Interesting - what would solve that for you?"

**❌ Dismiss**:
Bad: "That's on the roadmap" [vague]
Good: "We're planning that for version 2.0 in Q1. Would that timing work?"

**❌ Make Excuses**:
Bad: "We're just a small team, we can't do everything"
Good: "Fair point. With limited resources, we prioritized X. Should we reconsider?"

**❌ Delete or Hide**:
- Never delete negative comments (makes you look shady)
- Don't hide criticism with edits
- Own mistakes publicly

## Emergency Protocol: If Things Go Wrong

### Scenario 1: Post Gets Removed

**Immediate Actions**:

4. Do NOT repost immediately
5. Wait 7+ days if you want to try again with different approach

> "Hi mods, my post about [topic] was removed. I read the rules and believe I may have violated [specific rule]. I apologize and want to contribute properly. Could you clarify what I should avoid in the future? Thanks for maintaining the community quality."

---

### Scenario 2: Getting Downvoted Heavily

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Don't delete (makes it worse)
2. Read comments to understand why
3. Respond humbly, acknowledging concerns
4. Learn from feedback

---

### Scenario 4: Shadowbanned

**How to Check**:
- Log out and visit your profile URL
- If it shows "user not found," you're shadowbanned
- Or use r/ShadowBan to check

**How to Fix**:
1. Message Reddit admins (not mods)
2. Explain situation honestly
3. Commit to following guidelines
