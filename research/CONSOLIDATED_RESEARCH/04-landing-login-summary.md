### Problem/Solution Section

**Headline:** "Philosophy Deserves Better"
**Subheadline:** "Current platforms force you to choose between depth and accessibility. We believe you can have both."

**3 Problem Cards (3 columns):**

1. **"Shallow Social Media"** 📱
   - "Twitter limits depth to 280 characters. Reddit threads die in 48 hours. Your thoughtful ideas deserve more than hot takes and disappearing conversations."

2. **"Academic Gatekeeping"** 🚪
   - "Traditional philosophy spaces feel exclusive and intimidating. Jargon-heavy discussions make curious beginners feel unwelcome. Philosophy should be for everyone."

3. **"Toxic Debate Culture"** 🌀
   - "Debate platforms reward winning over learning. Combat metaphors and zero-sum thinking create hostility. Changing your mind should be celebrated, not punished."

**Solution Statement:**
> "Parley is the missing middle: serious inquiry that's genuinely accessible, persistent discussions that build understanding, and AI that makes you think harder—not for you."
