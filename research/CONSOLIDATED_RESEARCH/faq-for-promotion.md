## Core Platform Questions

### 1. How does ARGUED work?

**Short**:
Create or join philosophical conversations that persist over time. Discussions can be unstructured, structured debates, or reading groups - with optional AI facilitation.

**Medium**:
ARGUED is a platform for sustained philosophical conversations. You can start unstructured discussions, structured debates (with positions and rebuttals), or reading groups. Conversations persist over weeks/months with proper threading so you can track complex arguments. Optional AI features help facilitate, summarize, or steelman arguments. Think of it as purpose-built infrastructure for the kind of deep discussions that don't work well on Twitter or Reddit.

**Detailed**:
ARGUED provides infrastructure for three types of philosophical engagement:

1. **Unstructured Conversations**: Like Reddit threads but persistent, with better threading and ability to branch/reconnect discussions over time
2. **Structured Debates**: Optional formal debate format with opening positions, rebuttals, and steelmanning requirements
3. **Reading Groups**: Tools for discussing texts together, with references, quotes, and synchronized reading

Key features:
- Persistent conversations (don't die after 2 days)
- Advanced threading to track complex arguments
- Optional AI facilitation (summarizing, steelmanning, mediating)
- Reading group tools (shared texts, synchronized progress)
- Privacy controls (public, private, or semi-private discussions)
- No engagement optimization algorithms
- Designed for depth over speed

You participate at your own pace - it's async by design. Join conversations you care about, contribute when you have time.

### 2. Is it free?

**Short**:
Yes, free to use. No current paid tiers, though we may add premium features later while keeping core functionality free.

**Medium**:
Currently completely free. We may introduce optional premium features in the future (like extended AI facilitation, private groups with more features, or advanced moderation tools), but the core platform will remain free. Philosophy discussions shouldn't be behind a paywall.

**Detailed**:
ARGUED is free to use. Core features - creating discussions, participating in conversations, reading groups, basic debate structure - will always be free.

We may introduce optional premium features in the future:
- Extended AI facilitation (more sophisticated features)
- Advanced reading group tools
- Private communities with enhanced moderation
- Analytics and discussion insights
- Priority support

Philosophy: The ability to have serious philosophical conversations shouldn't require payment. Premium features would be add-ons for specific use cases, not gates to basic functionality.

If you're an educator or researcher with specific needs, contact us - we're open to academic partnerships.

---

### 3. What's the business model?

**Short**:
TBD. Exploring: optional premium features, institutional partnerships, grants. Core platform will stay free.

**Medium**:
Honest answer: figuring it out. Options being explored: optional premium features (advanced AI, private communities), partnerships with universities/institutions, grants for public philosophy infrastructure. Core commitment: basic philosophical discourse features stay free. Not interested in ads or engagement optimization - those incentives are misaligned with good conversations.

**Detailed**:
Transparently: we're in early stages and exploring sustainable models that don't compromise the platform's purpose.

**What we're considering**:
- Optional premium features for power users (advanced AI, analytics, private communities)
- Institutional partnerships (universities, philosophy departments, research groups)
- Grants focused on public philosophy and intellectual infrastructure
- Non-profit or public benefit corporation structure

**What we won't do**:
- Advertising (creates wrong incentives)
- Sell user data
- Engagement optimization algorithms
- Paywall basic philosophical discourse

**Philosophy**:
The business model needs to align with the mission: supporting good philosophical conversations. That means avoiding revenue models that would incentivize addictive design, echo chambers, or shallow engagement. We're okay with slower growth if it means building something sustainable and aligned.

If you're interested in supporting this kind of infrastructure, we're open to conversations about partnerships, sponsorships, or grants.

### 4. How do you prevent low-quality discussions?

**Short**:
No engagement algorithms, optional structure (debates require steelmanning), community norms, and thoughtful moderation focused on discourse quality rather than arbitrary rules.

**Medium**:
Several approaches: (1) No viral mechanics or engagement optimization - removes incentive for hot takes, (2) Optional structured debate format requires steelmanning opponents' arguments, (3) Community norms established early emphasizing charitable interpretation, (4) Moderation focused on discourse quality (bad faith, personal attacks) rather than content policing, (5) Threading and persistence reward sustained thought over quick reactions. That said, it ultimately depends on the community we build.

**Detailed**:
Quality discussions require both structural design and community norms:

**Structural Approaches**:
1. **No engagement optimization**: No algorithms amplifying controversial content, no viral mechanics, no "trending" that rewards hot takes
2. **Structured debate options**: When using debate format, requires steelmanning opponent's position before rebutting
3. **Threading and persistence**: Rewards careful, sustained arguments over quick hot takes
4. **Async design**: Gives people time to think and respond thoughtfully
5. **Optional AI facilitation**: Can help identify logical fallacies, suggest steelmanning, or mediate

**Community Norms** (being established early):
- Charitable interpretation of opponents
- Distinguishing disagreement from disrespect
- Citing sources and being specific
- Admitting uncertainty when appropriate
- Steelmanning before criticizing
- Focusing on ideas, not people

**Moderation Philosophy**:
- Focus on discourse quality, not content policing
- Remove bad faith, personal attacks, trolling
- Don't remove controversial positions if argued in good faith
- Transparent moderation with appeals process
- Community-driven moderation as we grow

**Reality check**: No system is perfect. We'll learn and adapt. Early users shape the culture, which is why we're careful about growth.

### 5. What makes this different from debates?

**Short**:
Debates are one option, not the only format. You can have unstructured conversations, reading groups, or structured debates - switch between them as needed.

**Medium**:
ARGUED supports multiple formats, not just debates. You can have open-ended philosophical conversations (like Socratic dialogue), structured debates (with positions and rebuttals), or reading groups. The platform doesn't force everything into "debate" format. Think of it as flexible infrastructure that can be debate-like when you want structure, or free-flowing when you want exploration.

**Detailed**:
"Debate" implies a specific format: opposing sides, winning/losing, rhetorical skill mattering as much as truth-seeking. ARGUED supports this when appropriate, but it's not the only or primary format.

**Three Main Modes**:

1. **Unstructured Conversations**:
   - Open-ended exploration
   - Socratic questioning
   - Collaborative truth-seeking
   - No predetermined positions
   - Can branch, merge, evolve naturally

2. **Structured Debates**:
   - Clear positions stated upfront
   - Formal structure (opening, rebuttals, conclusions)
   - Steelmanning requirements
   - Useful when positions are clear and you want systematic comparison

3. **Reading Groups**:
   - Discussing texts together
   - Reference-based conversation
   - Collaborative interpretation
   - Not debate at all - collective understanding

**Key Difference from Traditional Debate**:
- Not about "winning" - about understanding
- Can change your mind mid-conversation (encouraged!)
- Collaborative elements even in structured formats
- No time pressure or rhetorical performance
- Focus on argument quality, not persuasion skill

The platform gives you structure when you want it, flexibility when you need it.

### 6. Is the AI required or optional?

**Short**:
Completely optional. All core features work without AI. You can turn it off entirely or use it selectively.

**Medium**:
AI features are entirely optional. The core platform - conversations, threading, reading groups, debate structure - works perfectly without AI. When enabled, AI can help summarize long threads, steelman arguments, identify potential fallacies, or mediate complex discussions. Think of it as an optional facilitation tool, not a required feature. If you're uncomfortable with AI, turn it off and use the platform normally.

**Detailed**:
AI on ARGUED is optional facilitation, not core infrastructure.

**What AI Can Do** (when enabled):
- Summarize long discussion threads
- Steelman your opponent's argument (help you argue against the strongest version)
- Identify potential logical fallacies
- Suggest relevant philosophical concepts or references
- Mediate complex multi-party discussions
- Help structure arguments more clearly

**What AI Doesn't Do**:
- Generate your arguments (you write your own positions)
- Make decisions about the discussion
- Replace human conversation
- Force any particular structure or conclusion
- Access conversations without your permission

**Privacy**:
- AI is opt-in per conversation
- Private conversations stay private (not used for training)
- We use [Anthropic/OpenAI/specify your provider] with [their privacy policy]
- You can export and delete your data anytime

**Philosophy**:
AI is a tool for facilitating human philosophical discourse, not a replacement for it. Some people find it helpful for overcoming communication barriers or deepening arguments. Others prefer purely human conversation. Both are valid - you choose.

If you never enable AI, you'll never know it's there.

### 7. Who is this for?

**Short**:
Anyone interested in serious philosophical conversations: academics, students, independent scholars, thoughtful enthusiasts. From beginners to experts.

**Medium**:
ARGUED is for people who want to engage seriously with philosophical ideas, regardless of credentials. This includes: philosophy students and academics, independent scholars, thoughtful enthusiasts, reading groups, people frustrated with philosophy on Twitter/Reddit, interdisciplinary thinkers, and anyone who wants infrastructure for sustained philosophical discourse. You don't need a PhD - just genuine interest in careful thinking.

**Detailed**:
**Primary Audiences**:

1. **Academic Philosophers**:
   - Public philosophy beyond formal publications
   - Informal discussions with peers
   - Teaching and engaging with students
   - Interdisciplinary conversations

2. **Philosophy Students**:

### 8. What stage is the platform in?

**Short**:
Early stage. [X] users currently, actively developing based on early user feedback. Functional but evolving.

**Medium**:
We're in early launch - about [X] users, core features working, actively developing based on feedback. Think of it as functional beta: you can have real conversations now, but features are being added and refined. Early users have genuine influence on how it develops. Some rough edges, but the core experience works. If you want polished and huge, check back in 6 months. If you want to help build it, now's the time.

**Detailed**:
**Current Status** (as of [date]):
- **User base**: ~[X] active users
- **Stability**: Core features functional and stable
- **Feature completeness**: [70%/80%/etc] of planned v1 features live
- **Active development**: New features being added based on user feedback

**What's Working Well**:
- Core conversation threading
- Structured debate format
- Reading group basics
- User profiles and privacy controls
- [List other working features]

**What's In Development**:
- [Feature 1 being developed]
- [Feature 2 being developed]
- Mobile app/responsive design improvements
- Enhanced moderation tools
- [etc]

**What This Means for You**:
- ✅ You can have real, valuable conversations now
- ✅ Your feedback directly influences development
- ✅ You'll help establish community norms
- ⚠️ Some features are still being refined
- ⚠️ User base is small (but growing)
- ⚠️ Occasional bugs or rough edges

**Where We're Going**:
- Short term (3 months): Polish core features, grow to [X] users, establish community norms
- Medium term (6-12 months): Mobile apps, enhanced features, scaling community
- Long term: Sustainable infrastructure for philosophical discourse online

**Join now if**: You want to shape what this becomes and are okay with early-stage roughness.

**Wait if**: You want a polished, large-scale platform and are happy with current solutions.

We're transparent about where we are and where we're going. This is a real project with real potential, but we're honest about being early.

### 9. Can I import my existing discussions?

**Short**:
Not automatically yet, but you can copy/paste conversations or start fresh. Import tools are on the roadmap.

**Medium**:
Currently no automatic import from Reddit, Twitter, etc. You can manually recreate discussions you want to continue here. Import/export tools are on the roadmap - would be great to migrate reading groups or long threads from other platforms. If you have specific import needs (like a long Reddit thread or email discussion you want to continue), let us know and we can prioritize those tools.

**Detailed**:
**Current State**:
No automatic import tools yet. If you want to continue a discussion from another platform:
1. Copy the relevant content
2. Create a new discussion on ARGUED
3. Paste with attribution
4. Tag participants if they're on the platform
5. Link to original for context

**Planned Import Features** (roadmap):
- Reddit thread import (preserving structure and attribution)
- Twitter thread import
- Email discussion import
- Generic text/markdown import with formatting
- Bulk import for reading groups

**Export Capabilities**:
- Already supported: Export your discussions as markdown/PDF
- Download your complete data
- Share individual threads publicly

**Why This Matters**:
Many valuable discussions happen on platforms not designed for them. Being able to migrate a Reddit thread that's about to die, or a Twitter conversation that needs more space, is important. We're building these tools.

**Timeline**: Basic import tools in [X months/timeframe]. Complex imports (preserving full threading from Reddit) will take longer.

**In the Meantime**:
If you have a discussion you really want to migrate, contact us. We can potentially help manually import significant conversations, especially if they'd be valuable for the community.

### 10. How do you handle moderation?

**Short**:
Focus on discourse quality (bad faith, personal attacks) rather than content policing. Community-driven as we scale. Transparent with appeals.

**Medium**:
Moderation philosophy: remove bad faith, personal attacks, and trolling, but don't police controversial positions argued in good faith. We focus on *how* people discuss, not *what* they discuss. Early stage: hands-on moderation by core team. As we grow: community-driven moderation with clear guidelines. All moderation actions are transparent with appeals process. Goal is philosophical discourse norms, not arbitrary rules.

**Detailed**:
**Moderation Philosophy**:

Philosophy discussions require robust disagreement while maintaining discourse quality. Our approach:

**What We Remove**:
- ❌ Bad faith arguments (not genuinely engaging)
- ❌ Personal attacks (ad hominem)
- ❌ Trolling and harassment
- ❌ Spam or promotional content
- ❌ Violations of privacy or consent
- ❌ Illegal content

**What We Don't Remove**:
- ✅ Controversial positions argued in good faith
- ✅ Disagreement or criticism (even harsh)
- ✅ Unpopular views
- ✅ Questioning fundamental assumptions
- ✅ Calling out weak arguments (if substantive)

**The Distinction**:
"Your argument commits a category error and here's why" = Fine
"You're an idiot" = Not fine

"I think your position leads to absurd conclusions: [reasoning]" = Fine
"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard" = Not fine

**Moderation Structure**:

*Currently (early stage)*:
- Core team reviews reported content
- Quick response to clear violations
- Discussion of edge cases
- Direct communication with users

*Future (scaling)*:
- Community moderators (earned through participation)
- Clear, public moderation guidelines
- Transparent moderation log
- Appeals process
- Diverse moderation team

**Transparency**:
- Public moderation guidelines
- Explanations for removals
- Appeals process for disagreements
- Periodic transparency reports

**Edge Cases**:
Some discussions will be genuinely difficult to moderate (free will vs determinism might get heated; critiques of various philosophical schools might feel personal). Our approach:
1. Give benefit of the doubt
2. Focus on discourse quality
3. Let community self-moderate when possible
4. Intervene when discussions become unproductive
5. Learn and adapt our guidelines

**Your Role**:
- Report bad faith or rule violations
- Model good discourse
- Help establish community norms
- Provide feedback on moderation decisions

Philosophy: Moderation should enable good discourse, not police thought. We'll err on the side of allowing disagreement while stopping abuse.

## Community & Content Questions

### 14. What kinds of topics are appropriate?

**Short**:
Any philosophical topic - ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, philosophy of mind, applied philosophy, etc. Also interdisciplinary questions with philosophical dimensions.

**Medium**:
If it involves careful thinking about fundamental questions, it fits. Traditional philosophy topics (ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, etc.) obviously work. But also: philosophy of science, political philosophy, applied ethics, philosophy of mind, aesthetics, logic, philosophical aspects of current events, interdisciplinary questions. The key is substantive engagement with ideas, not necessarily academic pedigree.

**Detailed**:
**Core Philosophy Topics** (obviously welcome):
- Ethics & Moral Philosophy
- Metaphysics & Ontology
- Epistemology
- Logic & Philosophy of Language
- Political Philosophy
- Aesthetics
- Philosophy of Mind
- Philosophy of Science
- Existentialism & Phenomenology
- Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Contemporary Philosophy

**Applied & Interdisciplinary** (also welcome):
- Applied ethics (medical, environmental, tech, business)
- Philosophy of specific domains (mathematics, physics, biology, etc.)
- Philosophical aspects of current events
- Cross-disciplinary questions (philosophy & neuroscience, AI ethics, etc.)
- Philosophy in literature, film, art
- Informal logic and argumentation
- Philosophical implications of technology

**Style & Level**:
- Academic discussions of scholarly work
- Beginner questions about basic concepts
- Contemporary applications of classical philosophy
- Original arguments and thought experiments
- Critical analysis of published work
- Collaborative truth-seeking on open questions

**Not Appropriate**:
- Pure politics without philosophical framing
- Personal advice without philosophical dimension
- Purely empirical questions (unless philosophically relevant)
- Promotion/advertising
- Trolling or bad faith

**The Test**:
Is this a question/topic that benefits from careful, sustained philosophical analysis? If yes, it's appropriate.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Is determinism compatible with moral responsibility?"
- ✅ "Reading group for Kant's First Critique"
- ✅ "Ethical implications of AI-generated art"
- ✅ "What is personal identity? Ship of Theseus discussion"
- ✅ "Philosophy of time in physics vs philosophy"
- ❌ "Who should I vote for?" (political, not philosophical)
- ❌ "What's the best philosophy book?" (subjective list)
- ✅ "What makes a philosophical argument strong?" (meta-philosophical)

When in doubt: frame your question philosophically, engage substantively, and you'll be fine.

---

### 15. Is there a community or just one-off discussions?

**Short**:
Both. You can have one-off discussions or build ongoing community through reading groups, recurring topics, and following people/discussions you care about.

**Medium**:
ARGUED supports both modes: (1) One-off discussions about specific questions, useful when you just want to explore a topic once, and (2) Ongoing community through reading groups that meet regularly, following particular thinkers or topics, and persistent conversations you can return to. You define your engagement level. Some people treat it like a tool for specific discussions; others build lasting intellectual community.

**Detailed**:
**Community Features**:

*Persistent Relationships*:
- Follow users whose thinking you appreciate
- Build reading groups that continue over time
- Return to long-running conversations
- Develop shared context and understanding

*Reading Groups as Community*:
- Ongoing groups discussing series of texts
- Regular meetings/discussions
- Shared intellectual project
- Builds relationships through sustained engagement

*Topic Communities*:
- Follow specific philosophical areas (ethics, metaphysics, etc.)
- See ongoing discussions in your interests
- Contribute to evolving conversations

*One-Off Discussions*:
- Ask a question, get answers, move on
- Perfect for specific curiosities
- No obligation to return

**How This Works**:
- You choose your commitment level
- Can participate in some communities deeply, others lightly
- No pressure to be "always on"
- Async design means you engage at your pace

**Building Community**:
Early users are literally building the community norms. You can:
- Start a reading group that becomes a regular thing
- Establish a sub-community around specific topics
- Build relationships with like-minded thinkers
- Create the culture you want to see

**Community Spaces**:
- Public discussions (open to all)
- Private groups (reading groups, seminars)
- Semi-public (unlisted but shareable)

**It's What You Make It**:
Some people will use this like StackOverflow for philosophy (ask question, get answer, leave). Others will build deep intellectual communities. Both are valid. The infrastructure supports both modes.

### 17. What's the character/length limit?

**Short**:
No arbitrary limits. Write as much or as little as your argument requires. This is designed for long-form philosophical writing.

**Medium**:
No arbitrary character limits like Twitter. Write what your argument needs - whether that's a paragraph or a 5,000-word essay. The platform is designed for sustained, long-form philosophical discourse. That said, be considerate: if you're posting a very long argument, consider breaking it into well-structured sections or multiple threaded responses for readability.

**Detailed**:
**Length Philosophy**:
Philosophy requires space to breathe. Some arguments need 200 words; some need 2,000. We don't impose artificial limits.

**Practical Limits**:
- No hard character limit for posts
- Reasonable technical limit (probably ~50,000 characters = ~10,000 words)
- If you're writing a full paper, consider breaking into sections
- Can link to longer documents and discuss them

**Best Practices**:
- Write what the argument requires
- Structure long posts with headers/sections
- Use threading for complex multi-part arguments
- Consider readability (walls of text are hard to engage with)
- Break very long arguments into digestible pieces

**Different Lengths for Different Needs**:
- Quick question: One paragraph
- Argument: Several paragraphs to a page
- Detailed analysis: Multiple pages
- Reading group response: Whatever the text requires

**Formatting Support**:
- Markdown for structure
- Quote blocks for references
- Lists and headers
- Code blocks for formal logic

**Reading Experience**:
Long posts are formatted for readability with:
- Collapsible sections for very long content
- Table of contents for structured arguments
- Threading so you can respond to specific parts
- Ability to reference specific paragraphs

**Compare to Other Platforms**:
- Twitter: 280 characters (not enough for philosophy)
- Reddit: ~40,000 characters (often too short for detailed arguments)
- ARGUED: Write what you need

**When to Split Up Long Content**:
- If you have multiple distinct arguments, thread them
- If it's a 10-page paper, consider posting in sections
- If it's a long reading group response, maybe split by chapter/theme
- Use judgment: can people meaningfully engage with this in one post?

**The Goal**: Enough space for serious philosophy, structured enough to be readable.

## Privacy & Safety Questions

### 18. Who can see my discussions?

**Short**:
You control this. Discussions can be public (anyone), unlisted (only people with link), or private (invited participants only).

**Medium**:
Three privacy levels: (1) Public - anyone can find and read, searchable, (2) Unlisted - only people with the link can access, not searchable, (3) Private - only explicitly invited participants can see or participate. You set this when creating a discussion and can change it later. Default is public for open philosophical discourse, but use private for sensitive discussions or small reading groups.

**Detailed**:
**Privacy Levels**:

*Public Discussions*:
- Anyone can find and read
- Appears in browse/search
- Can be shared freely
- Good for: Open philosophical questions, building community, general discourse
- Example: "Is free will an illusion?" - benefit from wide participation

*Unlisted Discussions*:
- Only people with the link can access
- Not searchable or browsable
- Not truly "private" but not advertised
- Good for: Semi-private reading groups, classroom discussions you don't want public but might share
- Example: Class discussion you want to share with colleagues but not make fully public

*Private Discussions*:
- Only explicitly invited participants
- Can't be found or accessed without invitation
- Completely private
- Good for: Sensitive topics, small reading groups, personal philosophical exploration
- Example: Reading group with specific friends

**Changing Privacy**:
- Set on creation
- Can change later (with appropriate warnings)
- Can't make private discussions public without all participants' consent
- Can make public discussions private (but consider: already indexed/archived?)

**Who Can Participate** (vs who can see):
- Public: anyone can read, only registered users can comment
- Unlisted: anyone with link can read, permission required to comment
- Private: only invited people can see or comment

**Profile Privacy**:
- Your profile is public by default (shows your public contributions)
- Can make profile private (only username visible)
- Can participate anonymously in specific discussions

**Search Engines**:
- Public discussions: indexed by search engines
- Unlisted/Private: not indexed

**Moderation Access**:
- Moderators can access reported content for moderation purposes
- Private discussions are private except for moderation needs
- Transparent about when moderation accesses private content

**Best Practices**:
- Default to public for general philosophy (benefits from open discourse)
- Use unlisted for semi-private groups
- Use private for sensitive topics or very small groups
- Consider: once something is public, it can be screenshot/archived

**Your Control**: You decide who sees what. Philosophy should be open when possible, protected when necessary.

### 20. How do I report abuse or problems?

**Short**:
Report button on every post/discussion. Flag bad faith, harassment, spam, or rule violations. Moderators review quickly.

**Medium**:
Every post and discussion has a "Report" button. Use it to flag: bad faith arguments, personal attacks, harassment, spam, or rule violations. Reports go to moderators who review quickly (usually within [X hours]). You can also block users or leave discussions that become unproductive. For serious issues (threats, illegal content), we have expedited review and will work with authorities if needed.

**Detailed**:
**Reporting System**:

*What to Report*:
- Bad faith arguments (not genuinely engaging)
- Personal attacks or harassment
- Trolling or disruptive behavior
- Spam or promotional content

- Illegal content
- Threats or dangerous content

*How to Report*:
1. Click "Report" button on any post/comment
2. Select reason for report
3. Add context (optional but helpful)
4. Submit

*What Happens*:
- Report goes to moderation queue
- Moderators review (target: within [X] hours)
- Action taken if warranted (warning, removal, ban)
- Reporter notified of outcome
- Reported user can appeal

**Other Tools**:

*Block User*:
- Hides their content from you
- They can't interact with your posts
- Doesn't affect their presence otherwise
- Use for personal preference, not rule violations

*Leave Discussion*:
- Stop participating in unproductive thread
- Opt out of notifications
- Remove yourself from private discussions

*Mute Notifications*:

4. Further appeal to [governance structure]

**False Reports**:
- Repeated false reports are themselves a violation
- Don't report just because you disagree
- Don't use reports to silence opposing views
- Report actual rule violations and bad faith

**What Isn't Reportable**:
- Disagreeing with someone's philosophical position
- Arguments you think are wrong
- Unpopular opinions argued in good faith
- Criticism of ideas (as opposed to people)

**Example**:
- ❌ Report: "This person thinks consequentialism is wrong" (disagreement)
- ✅ Report: "This person called me an idiot for being a consequentialist" (personal attack)

**Response Time**:
- Typical reports: Within [X hours]
- Serious issues: Within [X minutes/hours]
- Appeals: Within [X days]

**Transparency**:
- Regular moderation logs (what was removed and why)

## Comparison Questions

### 21. How is this different from Kialo?

**Short**:
Kialo is debate-focused with specific structure. ARGUED supports debates but also unstructured conversations and reading groups - more flexible for different types of philosophical discourse.

**Medium**:
Kialo is great for structured debates with pro/con trees. ARGUED supports that format when you want it, but we're designed to be more flexible - you can have unstructured Socratic dialogues, reading groups, or debates, and switch between them. Think of Kialo as debate-first, ARGUED as conversation-first with optional structure. If Kialo works for your needs, keep using it! This is for different kinds of philosophical engagement.

**Detailed**:
**Similarities**:
- Both support structured argumentation
- Both designed for substantive discourse
- Both better than Twitter/Reddit for sustained arguments
- Both focus on ideas over engagement metrics

**Key Differences**:

*Flexibility*:
- Kialo: Debate structure (pro/con tree)
- ARGUED: Multiple formats (debates, conversations, reading groups)

*Use Cases*:
- Kialo: Best for mapping out debate positions systematically
- ARGUED: Debates plus reading groups, Socratic dialogue, open exploration

*Structure*:
- Kialo: Always structured (that's the point)
- ARGUED: Optional structure - use when helpful, ignore when not

*Reading Groups*:
- Kialo: Not designed for this
- ARGUED: Explicit reading group tools

*AI Features*:
- Kialo: [their approach]
- ARGUED: Optional AI facilitation, steelmanning, summarization

*Community*:
- Kialo: Discussion-focused
- ARGUED: Discussion + reading groups + communities

**When to Use Each**:

*Use Kialo for*:
- Systematic debate mapping
- Pro/con analysis
- Structured position comparison

*Use ARGUED for*:
- Reading groups
- Exploratory conversations
- Debates that might evolve beyond initial positions
- Mixed formats (start unstructured, add structure later)
- Sustained conversations over weeks/months

**Can Use Both**:
These aren't mutually exclusive! Use Kialo for mapping debates, ARGUED for reading groups and conversations.

**Philosophy Difference**:
- Kialo optimizes for debate structure
- ARGUED optimizes for conversational flexibility

Neither is "better" - they're for different things.

### 22. Why not just use Discord or Slack?

**Short**:
Discord/Slack are real-time chat tools. Philosophy needs persistent, threaded, long-form discussions that don't disappear in scrolling. Different tools for different needs.

**Medium**:
Discord and Slack are built for real-time chat, which creates problems for philosophical discourse: conversations move too fast for careful thought, long messages get broken up, threads get buried in scrolling, hard to track complex arguments, and timezone issues exclude people. ARGUED is designed for async, persistent, long-form discourse. Use Discord for community chat; use ARGUED for sustained philosophical conversations. Complementary tools.

**Detailed**:
**Discord/Slack Strengths**:
- Real-time community
- Casual conversation
- Quick questions/answers
- Social bonding
- Low-friction communication

**Discord/Slack Problems for Philosophy**:

*Speed*:
- Conversations move too fast for reflection
- Pressure to respond quickly
- Favors quick takes over careful thought

*Threading*:
- Threading exists but is limited
- Complex arguments get fragmented
- Hard to track multi-branch discussions

*Persistence*:
- Conversations scroll away
- Hard to find old discussions
- No proper archiving for long-term reference

*Long-Form*:
- Long messages get broken up
- Not designed for essay-length arguments
- Hard to properly format complex reasoning

*Timezone*:
- Real-time bias favors certain timezones
- Miss conversations if you're not online
- Async philosophy works better

*Format*:
- Chat format, not discussion format
- Not designed for structured debate
- Reading groups awkward

**ARGUED Designed Differently**:

*Async*:
- Respond when you have time to think
- No pressure for immediate replies
- Works across timezones

*Persistence*:
- Conversations last weeks/months
- Searchable and archivable
- Build on previous discussions

*Long-Form*:
- Write what your argument needs
- Proper formatting for complex ideas
- Reference and quote tools

*Threading*:
- Sophisticated threading for complex arguments
- Branch and merge discussions
- Track multiple sub-arguments

*Structure*:
- Optional debate format
- Reading group tools
- Designed for philosophical discourse specifically

**When to Use Each**:

*Use Discord/Slack for*:
- Philosophy community chat
- Quick questions
- Social connection
- Coordinating events
- Casual philosophical banter

*Use ARGUED for*:
- Sustained philosophical arguments
- Reading groups
- Structured debates
- Long-form analysis
- Discussions that need to persist

**Combination**:
Many communities might use both:
- Discord for community chat and coordination
- ARGUED for serious discussions and reading groups
- Link between them as appropriate

**Real Example**:
Philosophy Discord server uses chat for daily interaction, but when someone asks "Is consciousness physical?", that conversation would work better on ARGUED where it can develop over days with careful arguments.

**Bottom Line**:
Different tools for different needs. Discord is for community; ARGUED is for discourse.

## Meta Questions

### 23. What makes you think this will succeed where others failed?

**Short**:
Honest answer: might not! But focusing on specific problems (persistent philosophical discourse) rather than broad "discussion platform." Success = useful tool for serious conversations, not massive scale.

**Medium**:
Fair question. Many platforms have failed. What's different: (1) Focused scope - philosophical discourse specifically, not general discussion, (2) Not trying to be huge - success is useful tool for serious conversations, not massive scale, (3) Avoiding bad incentives - no ads, no engagement optimization, no growth-at-all-costs, (4) Building with community input early rather than scaling first. Might still fail! But trying to learn from what's worked and failed before.

**Detailed**:
**Why Platforms Fail**:
- Chicken-egg problem (no users → no content → no users)
- Wrong incentives (ad-driven → optimize engagement → bad discourse)
- Too broad (trying to be everything → being nothing well)
- Scaling before product-market fit
- Ignoring community needs for growth
- Unsustainable business models

**What We're Doing Differently**:

*Focused Scope*:
- Not trying to be Reddit/Twitter/Discord replacement
- Specifically for philosophical discourse
- Better to do one thing well than many things poorly
- Narrow enough to have clear value proposition

*Definition of Success*:
- Not "millions of users"
- Success = useful tool for thousands of people having good conversations
- Quality over scale
- Sustainable, not hockey-stick growth

*Incentive Alignment*:
- No advertising (wrong incentives)
- Not optimizing for engagement
- Not growth-at-all-costs
- Building sustainable model aligned with mission

*Community-First*:
- Building with early users, not for hypothetical masses
- Listening to feedback and adapting
- Letting community shape direction
- Not imposing top-down vision

*Learning from Others*:
- Studying what worked: Reddit's early communities, LessWrong's norms, Kialo's structure
- Studying what failed: Google+, countless discussion forums
- Not reinventing wheels that work
- Avoiding mistakes we can see coming

**Realistic Risks**:

*Might Still Fail Because*:
- Can't solve chicken-egg (too small to be useful)
- Can't find sustainable business model
- Build wrong features/focus
- Get out-competed by better-resourced platforms
- Philosophy community doesn't need this
- Technical execution fails

**Being Honest**:
- No guarantee of success
- Many things we're figuring out
- Might not work despite best efforts
- That's okay - worth trying

**Why Try Anyway**:

*Specific Problem*:
- People genuinely struggle to have good philosophy discussions online
- Existing platforms don't solve this well
- Worth attempting a purpose-built solution

*Sustainable Approach*:
- Not betting the farm on this
- Growing sustainably
- If it doesn't work, we'll know fairly quickly
- Low-stakes experimentation

*Value Even If "Fails"*:
- If 500 people have better conversations here, that's success
- Doesn't need to be Instagram-scale
- Niche tools can be valuable

**What Would Make This Succeed**:
- Solving real problems people actually have
- Building community that values good discourse
- Finding sustainable business model
- Focusing on quality
- Adapting based on learning
- Not compromising core mission for growth

**Honest Assessment**:
Odds of becoming huge platform: low
Odds of being useful tool for thousands: reasonable
Odds of learning valuable things trying: high

**Your Role**:
Early users literally determine if this works. If you find it useful and help shape it, it has a chance. If it doesn't solve real problems, it should fail.
