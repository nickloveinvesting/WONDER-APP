⏰ **International expansion**

⏰ **Enterprise and institutional**
- Universities and schools

### Don't Do

❌ **Compete on price**
- Don't start with $5/month to attract users
- Race to bottom destroys economics
- Attracts wrong users

❌ **Oversimplify content**
- "Philosophy in 5 minutes"
- Dumbed-down for masses
- Our audience wants depth

❌ **Launch without partnerships**
- Need creators for acquisition
- Need academics for credibility
- Can't build everything in-house

❌ **Ignore community quality**

---

## Conclusion

The philosophy app should **target established professionals (tech, creative, professional services) as primary revenue drivers**, while **partnering with content creators and academics** for acquisition and credibility. **Student and educator segments** provide community value and future growth but aren't primary revenue sources initially.

This segmentation strategy balances:
- **Revenue:** High-value professional users
- **Growth:** Creator-driven acquisition
- **Credibility:** Academic partnerships
- **Community:** Mix of expertise levels
- **Future:** Student pipeline

By focusing on the **right segments in the right sequence**, we can build a sustainable, high-quality philosophy platform that serves serious learners while maintaining healthy economics.
