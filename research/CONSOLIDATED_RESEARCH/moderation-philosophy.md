# MODERATION PHILOSOPHY & IMPLEMENTATION
## Creating Self-Governing Intellectual Communities

**Mission**: Design moderation systems that preserve quality without stifling discourse

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Effective moderation is **invisible when working, decisive when needed**. PhiloDuel's moderation philosophy balances:
- **Free discourse** (all views welcome) with **quality standards** (rigor required)
- **Community autonomy** (self-governance) with **platform values** (non-negotiable principles)
- **Transparency** (all actions visible) with **efficiency** (fast resolution)
- **AI automation** (scalable) with **human judgment** (nuanced)

**Core Principle**: Moderate behavior, not beliefs. Ban trolls, not controversial ideas.

**2025 Research Insight**: Reddit's 466 hours/day of volunteer moderation ($3.4M annual value) shows community-driven moderation scales. AI-powered tools (harassment filters, rules check) reduce mod burden by 30-40%.

## THE MODERATION SPECTRUM

```
Under-Moderation ←──────────────────────→ Over-Moderation
(4chan chaos)         GOLDILOCKS ZONE      (totalitarian control)
                           ↓
                  PHILODUEL TARGET:
            "Light touch with clear boundaries"
```

### Problems with Under-Moderation
- ❌ Trolls drive away quality users
- ❌ Low-quality content floods platform
- ❌ Toxic behavior becomes normalized
- ❌ Echo chambers form unchecked
- ❌ Newcomers scared away

**Example**: 4chan (minimal moderation) = chaotic but low quality

### Problems with Over-Moderation
- ❌ Stifles authentic discourse
- ❌ Moderator bias silences views
- ❌ Users afraid to speak freely
- ❌ Community resentment builds
- ❌ Power abuse without checks

**Example**: Heavily censored forums = safe but sterile

### The Goldilocks Zone
- ✅ Clear, enforced boundaries (no personal attacks)
- ✅ Maximum freedom within boundaries (all ideas welcome)
- ✅ Community-driven quality control (voting, reporting)
- ✅ Transparent moderation (all actions logged)
- ✅ Appeals process (challenge unfair decisions)

**Example**: r/philosophy (strict rules, transparent enforcement, quality preserved)

## PHILODUEL'S MODERATION PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Moderate Behavior, Not Beliefs**

**Allowed** (even if controversial):
- ✅ Defending moral relativism
- ✅ Arguing for determinism (no free will)
- ✅ Questioning objective morality
- ✅ Critiquing any philosophical school
- ✅ Atheist, theist, and agnostic arguments
- ✅ Unpopular political philosophy positions

**Not Allowed** (behavior violations):
- ❌ Personal attacks ("You're an idiot")
- ❌ Bad faith arguments (strawmanning, moving goalposts)
- ❌ Harassment (targeting individuals)
- ❌ Spam (promotional content, bots)
- ❌ Hate speech (dehumanizing groups)
- ❌ Threats or doxxing

**Principle**: Attack arguments, not people. Disagree without being disagreeable.

---

#### 2. **Transparency Over Secrecy**

**All moderation actions are logged publicly**:
- Removed posts → public log with reason
- Banned users → explanation provided
- Moderator decisions → open to community review
- Policy changes → community discussion required

**Why**: Prevents moderator abuse, builds trust, accountability

**Inspired by**: Wikipedia's transparent edit history, Reddit's public mod logs

---

#### 3. **Proportional Response**

**Graduated System**:
1. **Warning**: First offense, minor violation (auto or manual)
2. **Temporary Mute**: 24-hour cool-down period
3. **Temporary Ban**: 7-day ban for repeated violations
4. **Permanent Ban**: Only for severe or chronic violations

**Exception**: Immediate permanent ban for:
- Illegal content (CSAM, terrorism, etc.)
- Doxxing or threats
- Bot/spam networks
- Ban evasion

**Principle**: Everyone deserves a second chance (except bad actors)

---

#### 4. **Community-Driven, Platform-Guided**

**Community Controls**:
- Upvote/downvote system (democracy)
- Report functionality (community flagging)
- Vote-to-close (5 high-rep users can remove content)
- Elected moderators (quarterly elections)

**Platform Sets Boundaries**:
- Non-negotiable values (intellectual honesty, good faith, respect)
- Universal rules (no harassment, spam, hate speech)
- Quality standards (minimum argumentation standards)
- Override power (rare but necessary)

**Principle**: Community self-governance within constitutional boundaries

---

#### 5. **Appeals & Due Process**

**Every moderation action is appealable**:
1. User appeals decision (72-hour window)
2. Different moderator reviews (not original mod)
3. Evidence presented by both sides
4. Community input (optional, for controversial cases)
5. Final decision within 7 days

**Governance Council** (Philosopher Kings/Queens, 10K+ rep):
- Reviews systemic moderation issues
- Overturns egregious mod decisions
- Votes on major policy changes
- Quarterly transparency reports

**Principle**: Power requires checks and balances

---

## FIVE-TIER MODERATION SYSTEM

### Tier 1: AI & Automation (First Line of Defense)

**Automated Actions** (2025 AI-powered tools):

#### Spam Detection
- Duplicate content filtering
- Link validation (blacklist malicious sites)
- Bot account detection (behavior patterns)
- Promotional content flagging

**Tools**: Reddit's Crowd Control (reduces spam by 60%), custom ML models

#### Harassment Filter (2025 Reddit AI)
- Identifies harassment language
- Flags for human review
- Auto-removes severe cases
- **Accuracy**: ~85% (2025 research)

**Important**: AI suggests, humans decide (except obvious spam)

#### Rules Check Tool (2025 Reddit)
- Pre-publication rules check
- "Your post may violate rule X" warnings
- Reduces rule violations by 40%
- Helps users self-correct

#### Fallacy Detector (PhiloDuel-Specific)
- Identifies common fallacies (ad hominem, strawman, etc.)
- Flags for review (doesn't auto-remove)
- Educational (explains fallacy)
- Gamified (fallacy-free badges)

**Tools**: Custom NLP models trained on philosophical arguments

#### Citation Requirements
- Auto-checks for sources on factual claims
- Flags unsupported assertions
- Links to citation guides
- "Citation Champion" badge for compliance

---

### Tier 2: Community Moderation (Peer Review)

**Community Powers**:

#### Upvote/Downvote System
- Content quality signal
- Determines visibility
- Karma system (reputation)
- **Cost to downvote**: 1 rep (prevents abuse)

**Inspired by**: Stack Overflow (downvoting costs points, makes it meaningful)

#### Vote-to-Close
- **5 high-rep users (2000+)** can close/remove content
- Reasons: off-topic, low-quality, rule violation
- Appeals allowed
- Transparent (who voted, why)

**Inspired by**: Stack Overflow's community moderation (reduces mod burden by 50%)

#### Peer Review Tags
- "Well-Sourced" (community-awarded)
- "Good Faith Argument" (verified)
- "Steel Man" (strengthened opponent's position)
- "Strawman Alert" (community flag)
- "Ad Hominem Warning" (community flag)

**Purpose**: Crowd-sourced quality control, educational

#### Report System
- Community flags problematic content
- Categories: spam, harassment, off-topic, misinformation
- Threshold (10 reports) = automatic review
- False reporting penalties (lose rep)

---

## HANDLING SPECIFIC CHALLENGES

### Challenge 1: Echo Chambers

**Problem**: Communities become ideologically homogeneous

**Detection Metrics**:
- Ideological Diversity Score (0-1, target 0.7+)
- Dissenting opinion downvote rate
- Viewpoint representation in top debates

**Interventions**:
1. **Devil's Advocate Requirement**: Popular positions must face strongest counter-arguments
2. **Algorithm Diversity**: Feed shows opposing viewpoints (30% of content)
3. **Cross-School Debates**: Regular inter-school competitions
4. **"Changed My View" Incentives**: Reward changing minds over "winning"
5. **Ideological Diversity Badges**: Awarded to users engaging across schools

**Inspired by**: 2025 research on echo chambers (C. Thi Nguyen) - opposition must arrive unfiltered

---

### Challenge 2: Bad Faith Arguments

**Problem**: Trolls, strawmanning, moving goalposts, gish galloping

**Detection**:
- AI analysis of argument structure
- Community "Bad Faith" flags
- Pattern recognition (repeat offenders)
- Good Faith Score (0-100)

**Response**:
1. **Warning**: "Your argument appears to misrepresent the opponent's position"
2. **Community Education**: What is steel-manning, good faith, etc.
3. **Reputation Impact**: Bad faith reduces Good Faith Score
4. **Access Restrictions**: Low Good Faith Score (<40) = limited posting
5. **Temporary Ban**: Chronic bad faith (3+ warnings)

**Educational Approach**:
- "How to Argue in Good Faith" tutorial
- Examples of steel-manning
- Fallacy-free zone practice
- Mentor matching (learn from experts)

---

### Challenge 3: Controversial Topics

**Problem**: Topics that consistently generate toxicity (politics, religion, identity)

**Approach**: Don't ban topics, moderate discourse

**Special Rules for Controversial Channels**:
1. **Higher Reputation Gate**: 500+ rep to post in #contemporary-politics
2. **Good Faith Requirement**: Proven track record of respectful debate
3. **Active Moderation**: 2x moderator attention
4. **Citation Requirements**: Factual claims must be sourced
5. **Cool-Down Periods**: If thread gets toxic, 24-hour pause for reflection

**Philosophy-Specific Approach**:
- Separate philosophical questions from partisan politics
- "Is democracy superior to other systems?" (philosophical) ✅
- "Trump vs. Biden" (partisan politics) ❌
- Redirect political debates to philosophical principles

---

### Challenge 4: Expert Gatekeeping vs. Accessibility

**Problem**: Experts dismiss newcomers; newcomers feel intimidated

**Solutions**:

**Separate Spaces**:
- #philosophy-101 (no jargon, ELI5 required)
- #academic-philosophy (technical language expected)

**Glossary Integration**:
- Hover over philosophical terms for definitions
- "Explain like I'm 5" button (simplify argument)
- Jargon checker (flags inaccessible language)

**Cultural Norms**:
- "Helpful to Newcomers" badge (incentive)
- Downvote for condescension (community enforcement)
- Weekly "Beginner's Question Hour" (safe space)

**Moderator Intervention**:
- Redirect overly technical discussions to advanced channels
- Enforce "no stupid questions" rule in beginner spaces
- Celebrate great "ELI5" explanations

---

### Challenge 5: Moderator Bias & Abuse

**Problem**: Moderators are human, have biases, can abuse power

**Safeguards**:

**Transparency**:
- All mod actions logged publicly
- Reasons required for all removals/bans
- Community can review at any time

**Appeals Process**:
- Different mod reviews appeals
- Governance Council oversight
- Overturned decisions = strike against mod

**Checks & Balances**:
- Moderators moderate moderators (meta-moderation)
- Community elections (can vote out bad mods)
- Governance Council (final authority)
- Term limits (prevent entrenched power)

**Diversity**:
- Moderator team reflects philosophical diversity
- No ideological litmus tests
- Representation from multiple schools

**Training**:
- Moderator training program
- Case studies of difficult decisions
- Bias awareness training
- Regular feedback and coaching
