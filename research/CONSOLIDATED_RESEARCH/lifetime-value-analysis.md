## LTV Calculation Framework

### Formula Components

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) = ARPU × Average Customer Lifetime**

Where:
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** Monthly subscription revenue per user
- **Average Customer Lifetime:** How long a customer remains subscribed (in months)

**Alternative Formula:**
**LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate**

For SaaS with high gross margins (80-90%), simplified to:
**LTV = ARPU / Monthly Churn Rate**

### Key Assumptions

**Philosophy App Benchmarks:**

Based on educational SaaS and Patreon creator economy data:

- **Monthly Churn Rate:** 5-8% (mature product), 10-15% (early stage)
- **Average Subscription Length:** 12-20 months (mature), 6-10 months (early)
- **Gross Margin:** 85% (SaaS typical)
- **Price Increase Over Time:** Users willing to pay more as relationship deepens (+50-100% over 3 years based on Patreon data)

**Cohort Behavior:**
- **Months 1-3:** Highest churn (evaluation period)
- **Months 4-12:** Moderate churn (habit formation)
- **Months 12+:** Low churn (loyal customers)

- 50% annual retention (conservative)
- ARPU growth: 5%/year (price increases + upgrades)

**Cohort Value:**
