---

## Pattern 6: Community-First vs Product-First

### Product Hunt Insights (2024-2025)

**Finding**: Product Hunt increasingly dominated by well-funded companies
- **Investment required**: 100-200 hours for indie makers
- **Big company advantage**: Professional marketing teams
- **Alternative platforms**: Indie Hackers, OpenHunts (more supportive)

**Comparison Case Study**:
- **Product Hunt**: $800 promotion → 127 signups, 3 paying customers
- **Smaller platform**: Free launch → 89 signups, 12 paying customers
- **Lesson**: Smaller, engaged communities > large generic audiences

### Multi-Platform Strategy
- **Data**: 40% higher conversion with multi-platform approach
- **Engagement**: 60% better long-term engagement
- **Strategy**: Don't rely on single platform

### Pattern Analysis
- **What works**: Build community BEFORE launch, engage authentically, use multiple platforms
- **What fails**: One-and-done Product Hunt launch, purely promotional tone
- **For ARGUED**: Start with philosophy subreddits, Discord communities, then scale

---

## Pattern 7: Format Preferences by Platform

### Hacker News
- **Title**: Technical, specific, no superlatives
- **Content**: Text-only, focus on "try it out" functionality
- **Tone**: Modest, technical, developer-to-developer
- **Engagement**: Expect criticism, use it productively
- **Don't**: Link to sign-up pages, marketing material, blog posts

### Reddit
- **Title**: Personal pronouns (I, my, you), story-driven
- **Content**: Mix of text + visuals (screenshots, GIFs)
- **Tone**: Humble, seeking feedback
- **Format**: "I built this to solve X" works well
- **Subreddits**: r/SideProject (humble), r/philosophy (academic), r/SaaS (business)

### Product Hunt
- **Title**: Clear value proposition
- **Content**: Visual demos, screenshots, video
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable
- **Strategy**: Build community first, engage heavily on launch day
- **Reality**: Better for funded companies than indie makers (2025)

### TikTok/Instagram
- **Format**: Short-form, visual, lo-fi authenticity
- **Content**: Thought experiments, ancient wisdom, pop culture memes
- **Tone**: Accessible, relatable, not academic
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds crucial, use "comment generators"
- **Philosophy angle**: Stoicism-style practical wisdom

---

## Pattern 8: Emotional Language & Engagement

### Research-Backed Insights

**Moral/Emotional Words Impact** (PNAS Study):
- Each moral/emotional word = +20% reach (average)
- "Indignant disagreement" = 2x engagement on Facebook
- But: Authenticity crucial, can't just stuff keywords

**Best-Performing Emotional Triggers**:
1. **Curiosity**: Hidden, secret, revealed, unexpected
2. **Frustration**: Tired of, struggling with, broken
3. **Hope**: Finally, solution, fix, better way
4. **Validation**: You're not alone, everyone else
5. **Controversy**: Unpopular opinion, hot take, reality

### Headlines with Emotional Triggers

**High-performing examples**:
- "Tired of [problem]? Here's [solution]"
- "The hidden reason [problem exists]"
- "I struggled with [problem] for [time]. Here's what worked"
- "Does anyone else feel [frustration]?"
- "Why [common thing] is actually broken"

---

## Pattern 9: Visual Content Performance

### Reddit Best Practices (2024)
- **Screenshots/Demos**: PNG format (sharper text)
- **Minimum width**: 1200 pixels
- **What works**: Product in action, clear UI, readable text
- **Format preference**: Screenshots > videos > text-only

### Philosophy Content Specifics
- **Visual quotes**: Professional Canva-style designs
- **Memes**: Office/pop culture + philosophy quotes
- **Thought diagrams**: Visual argument maps
- **Video**: Talking head + text overlays (TikTok style)

### Platform Differences
- **Hacker News**: Text-only (no images in posts)
- **Reddit**: Images highly recommended
- **Product Hunt**: Video demo essential
- **Twitter/X**: Images get 35% more engagement
- **TikTok/Instagram**: Video required, text overlays help

---

## Pattern 10: Timing & Response Strategy

### Launch Timing
- **Hacker News**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST (tech audience awake)
- **Product Hunt**: Launch at 12:01 AM PST (full 24 hours on homepage)
- **Reddit**: Varies by subreddit (check peak hours)
- **Philosophy communities**: Evening/weekend (leisure browsing)

### Response Strategy (Crucial!)

**Hacker News**:
- Respond to every comment within first hour
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Provide technical details when asked
- Don't be defensive
- Example: Tool criticized as "unnecessary" → 47 customers

**Reddit**:
- Thank feedback providers
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Admit limitations honestly
- Update post with "Edit:" for common questions
- Engage with similar tools respectfully

**Product Hunt**:
- First 6 hours critical
- Respond to all comments
- Hunter engagement = algorithm boost
- Thank supporters specifically

## Successful Post Anatomy: Show HN Example

```
Show HN: ARGUED – Open-source philosophy discussion platform

I got frustrated with philosophy discussions dying in forum threads
and academic paywalls making quality discourse inaccessible.

ARGUED uses AI to facilitate conversations (not replace them), keeps
discussions persistent and well-organized, and makes philosophical
debate more accessible to curious learners, not just academics.

Built with [tech stack]. Everything's open source. Would love
feedback on the debate UI—it's the trickiest part.

Try it: [URL]
Code: [GitHub]
```

**Why this works**:
- Clear technical description
- Personal problem → solution story
- Specific about what AI does (transparency)
- Open source credibility
- Asks for specific feedback
- Provides both product and code links

---

## Successful Post Anatomy: Reddit r/philosophy Example

```
Where do you discuss philosophy online? (Not r/philosophy)

I love this subreddit for reading, but I've been looking for
somewhere to actually DEBATE philosophy—not just academic-style
Q&A, but real back-and-forth on ideas.

Discord servers get too chaotic. Forums go dead after 3 replies.
Academic platforms are gatekept. Twitter is... Twitter.

Does anyone else feel this gap? Where do you actually discuss
philosophy in-depth?

I started building something to solve this (ARGUED), but genuinely
curious—am I solving a real problem or just my own frustration?
```

**Why this works**:
- Question format invites engagement
- Validates common frustration
- Lists specific pain points (relatable)
- Honest vulnerability (building something)
- Asks for validation (not just promotion)
- Community-first approach

---

## Successful Post Anatomy: Product Hunt Example

```
ARGUED – Modern platform for philosophical conversations

The problem: Philosophy discussions online either die in forum
threads, get lost in Discord chaos, or hide behind academic paywalls.

What we built: A platform that keeps philosophical debates persistent,
well-organized, and accessible—with AI that facilitates (not replaces)
human discourse.

For: Philosophy students, curious learners, debate enthusiasts,
armchair philosophers who want quality discussions without gatekeeping.

What's special:
- Discussions don't die or get buried
- AI helps structure arguments (transparently)
- Beautiful, modern UI (philosophy deserves good design)
- Free and open source

We're academics and developers who got tired of philosophy feeling
inaccessible. Would love your feedback!
```

**Why this works**:
- Clear problem statement
- Specific solution
- Target audience spelled out
- Feature bullets (scannable)
- Human story (academics + developers)
- Asks for feedback (not just promotion)

## Anti-Patterns: What Doesn't Work

### 1. Marketing Speak on Hacker News
**Bad**: "Revolutionary platform disrupting philosophy"
**Good**: "Open-source discussion platform for philosophy"

### 2. Pure Promotion Without Value
**Bad**: "Check out my new app!"
**Good**: "I analyzed 500 philosophy forums and found [insight]"

### 3. Overselling/Superlatives
**Bad**: "The best, fastest, most innovative philosophy platform"
**Good**: "Modern alternative to traditional philosophy forums"

### 4. No Visual Demos (Reddit/PH)
**Bad**: Text-only description
**Good**: Screenshots, GIF walkthrough, video demo

### 5. Ignoring Comments
**Bad**: Post and disappear
**Good**: Respond to every comment first 6 hours

### 6. Defensive Responses to Criticism
**Bad**: "You don't understand our vision"
**Good**: "That's fair criticism. Here's what we're working on..."

### 7. Feature Lists Without Problem Context
**Bad**: "We have AI, forums, profiles, notifications..."
**Good**: "Discussions kept dying, so we made them persistent..."

### 8. Academic Jargon (Philosophy-Specific)
**Bad**: "Dialectical synthesis of epistemic frameworks"
**Good**: "Better way to debate ideas and track arguments"

---

## Philosophy-Specific Insights

### What Makes Philosophy Content Go Viral

1. **Accessibility over complexity**: Daily Stoic (3M followers) uses simple quotes + modern context
2. **Practical application**: "How to use Stoicism today" > "History of Stoic thought"
3. **Existential hooks**: Death, meaning, consciousness, free will
4. **Thought experiments**: Trolley problem (6M+ views on Sandel's lecture)
5. **Moral/political relevance**: Justice, ethics, social issues
6. **Visual presentation**: Memes, quote graphics, clean design
7. **Controversy**: "Is philosophy gatekept?" "Do we have free will?"

### The "Public Philosophy" Trend

**Movement**: Extend philosophical thinking beyond universities
**Audience**: Huge untapped market (millions on TikTok)
**Message**: "Philosophy has practical tools for everyone"
**ARGUED positioning**: Part of this movement

### Common Philosophy Discussion Pain Points

1. Forums go dead after a few replies
2. Discord too chaotic/ephemeral
3. Academic platforms gatekept
4. Reddit good for reading, not in-depth debate
5. Twitter too short/hostile
6. Philosophy appears elitist/inaccessible

**ARGUED addresses**: All of the above
