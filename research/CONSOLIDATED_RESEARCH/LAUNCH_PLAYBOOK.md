This is a **complete, copy-paste-ready launch kit** for ARGUED, containing:

✅ **Week-by-week launch timeline** with specific actions
✅ **Response templates** for all common questions and objections
✅ **Success metrics** and tracking frameworks

### Core Value Proposition

**ARGUED solves**: Philosophy discussions buried in noise (Reddit/Twitter), academic gatekeeping, ephemeral conversations (Discord), debate platforms focused on winning not learning, fragmented communities.

**ARGUED provides**: Quality discourse design, persistent searchable discussions, beginner-friendly to expert-level, AI facilitation (not judgment), modern UI, reading groups and Socratic dialogues.

### Launch Philosophy

**Quality over Quantity**: Better to have 100 deeply engaged philosophical thinkers than 10,000 passive scrollers. Every strategy in this playbook prioritizes quality users who will shape platform culture.

### Expected Results

**Conservative Estimates**:
- **Launch Week**: 1,000-3,000 signups
- **Month 1**: 3,000-6,000 total users
- **Month 3**: 8,000-15,000 total users
- **Quality Active Users**: 10-20% of signups

**Success Criteria**: Product Hunt Top 5, Hacker News front page, Daily Nous feature, 30%+ retention rate.

Show HN: ARGUED – Open-source philosophy discussion platform

I analyzed 500 philosophy forums and found 78% of discussions die after
3 replies. Forums are graveyards, Discord is chaos, Reddit threads ghost you.

Built ARGUED to solve this: persistent philosophical debates with AI-assisted
structure (not generation). Graph-based discussions, not linear threads.

Tech: Next.js, PostgreSQL, OpenAI (facilitation only)
Try it: https://argued.app

Feedback welcome, especially on the debate UI.

## Messaging Framework

### Core Value Propositions

**The Missing Middle**: "Serious but accessible philosophical discourse"
- Not as gatekept as academic journals
- Not as shallow as social media
- The space between Twitter and academia

**Quality Over Virality**: "Depth, not dopamine"
- Designed for thoughtful conversation, not engagement metrics
- Persistent discussions that mature over time
- No algorithmic feed, no karma farming

**AI That Makes You Think Harder**: "Socratic, not generative"
- AI asks better questions, doesn't give easy answers
- Facilitates human-to-human discussion
- Optional, not required

### Problem-Solution Matrix

| User Pain Point | Our Solution | Best Message |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Reddit discussions buried in noise | Persistent, organized threads | "Conversations that don't disappear after 24 hours" |
| Academic philosophy gatekept | Beginner-friendly community | "From curious questions to expert debates" |
| Discord conversations scroll away | Topic-based organization | "What you discussed last month is still findable" |
| Debate platforms too competitive | Optional debate mode | "Explore ideas, or debate them—your choice" |
| Fragmented across platforms | Unified space | "One home for your philosophy conversations" |

**See**: `problem-solution-matrix.md` for complete mapping (24+ problem-solution pairs)

### Audience-Specific Messaging

**Philosophy Students**: "Practice philosophical thinking without academic pressure"
**Academics**: "Bridge between Twitter chaos and academic journals"
**Curious Learners**: "Safe space to ask your first philosophy question"
**Debate Enthusiasts**: "Learn together, not just win arguments"
**Community Builders**: "All-in-one platform for reading groups and study circles"

**See**: `value-prop-by-audience.md` for detailed messaging per audience

### Elevator Pitches (10 variations)

1. **Problem-First**: "Philosophy discussions on Reddit disappear after 24 hours. Academic spaces are gatekept. ARGUED is the missing middle: serious but accessible philosophical conversations that persist."

2. **Solution-First**: "ARGUED is a platform for philosophical discussions with persistent threads, reading groups, Socratic dialogues, and optional AI facilitation. From beginner questions to expert debates."

3. **Gap-First**: "There's a gap between Twitter's hot takes and academic philosophy's gatekeeping. ARGUED fills it: thoughtful, accessible philosophical discourse."

[...7 more variations]

**See**: `messaging-testing-variants.md` for all 10 pitches + A/B test framework

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Reddit**: "Complementary, not replacement. Philosophy subreddits are great for discovery, ARGUED is designed for depth."

**vs. Discord**: "Discord is for real-time chat. ARGUED is for discussions you can find and reference months later."

**vs. ChatGPT**: "AI should make you think harder, not replace thinking. ARGUED uses Socratic AI to facilitate human-to-human discussion."

**See**: `unique-selling-points.md` for complete competitive analysis

## Response & Engagement Strategy

### Common Objections & How to Respond

#### "Why not just use Reddit?"

**Good Response**:
"Reddit's great for some things! But we're designing specifically for sustained philosophical conversations - persistent threads, reading groups, optional structured debates. Think of it as complementary to Reddit, not replacing it."

**Bad Response**:
"Reddit sucks for philosophy" ❌ (alienating, negative)

#### "Another social network?"

**Good Response**:
"I hear you - platform fatigue is real. ARGUED isn't trying to be another social network. It's a tool for a specific need: philosophical discussions that don't disappear. If you've felt that gap, might be worth trying."

**Bad Response**:
"We're different!" ❌ (generic, defensive)

#### "Chicken-egg problem - will this have users?"

**Good Response**:
"You're right, it's early! That's why I'm looking for philosophy enthusiasts who want to help shape this. First 100 users will have real influence on how it develops. Interested in being part of that?"

**Bad Response**:
"We'll have lots of users soon!" ❌ (empty promise)

**See**: `objection-handling-guide.md` for 9 major objections with multiple response strategies

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric

**Quality Active Users (QAU)**: Users who participated in 3+ substantive philosophical exchanges OR received a "changed mind" award

Why this matters more than total signups: Aligns with platform mission (quality discourse), predicts retention, indicates product-market fit.

### Platform-Specific Benchmarks

#### Product Hunt
- **Minimum Viable**: Top 20, 50+ upvotes
- **Good**: Top 10, 100+ upvotes
- **Exceptional**: Top 5, Product of the Day, 200+ upvotes

#### Hacker News
- **Minimum Viable**: 20+ points, 10+ comments
- **Good**: Front page (50+ points), 30+ comments
- **Exceptional**: Top 10, 100+ points, 50+ quality comments

#### Reddit (r/SideProject)
- **Minimum Viable**: 50+ upvotes, 20+ comments
- **Good**: 200+ upvotes, 50+ comments, 100+ clicks
- **Exceptional**: 500+ upvotes, 100+ comments, 1,000+ clicks

#### Overall Launch
- **Minimum Viable**: 300 signups, 50 active users, any press coverage
- **Good**: 1,000 signups, 200 active users, Product Hunt Top 5
- **Exceptional**: 3,000+ signups, 500+ active users, major press coverage (Daily Nous feature)

### Tracking Infrastructure

**UTM Parameters** (for each platform):
```
https://argued.app?utm_source=[platform]&utm_medium=[post_type]&utm_campaign=launch_2025
```

Examples:
- `utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=launch_2025`
- `utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=show_hn&utm_campaign=launch_2025`
- `utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=sideproject&utm_campaign=launch_2025`

**Master Tracking Spreadsheet** (columns):
- Date/Time Posted
- Platform
- Post Title
- Link to Post
- UTM Code
- Clicks
- Signups
- Active Users (7-day)
- Retention (30-day)
- Quality Score (1-10)
- Notes

**See**: `success-metrics-tracking.md` for complete tracking framework and spreadsheet template

### Quality vs. Quantity Metrics

**Quality Indicators**:
- Users who create substantive posts (not just lurk)
- Users who engage in 3+ exchanges
- "Changed mind" awards given/received
- Reading group participation
- Retention beyond 30 days

**Channel Quality Scoring**:
- Track signups by source
- Track 7-day and 30-day retention by source
- Track engagement quality by source
- Identify which channels drive best users (not just most users)

**When to Double Down**:
- Channel with high quality score (even if lower volume)
- Strong retention (30%+ at 30 days)
- Organic word-of-mouth from channel
- Community fit (users understand and embrace platform values)

**When to Pivot Away**:
- High signups but low activation
- Users don't match target audience
- Engagement is low-quality or toxic
- ROI on time investment is poor

**See**: `success-metrics-tracking.md`, Section 5: "When to Double Down vs. Pivot"

## Final Checklist

### ✅ Before You Launch

**Content Prepared**:
- [ ] All promotional posts customized (not just templates)
- [ ] Visual assets created (screenshots, demo video, logos)
- [ ] Landing page optimized for launch traffic
- [ ] Beta testimonials collected and ready to share
- [ ] Social proof prepared (user count, example discussions)

**Accounts Ready**:
- [ ] Reddit account: 200+ karma, 14+ day age, participation history
- [ ] Product Hunt: Profile complete, supporters recruited (20+)
- [ ] Twitter: Bio optimized, some existing tweets
- [ ] Discord/Facebook: Member of target communities
- [ ] Hacker News: Account exists (age helps but not required)

**Infrastructure Set**:
- [ ] Analytics tracking configured (Google Analytics + UTM parameters)
- [ ] Server capacity tested for traffic spike
- [ ] Support system ready (email, Discord, in-app)

**Team Aligned**:
- [ ] Launch day support confirmed (20+ hours availability)
- [ ] Backup responder identified if primary gets overwhelmed
- [ ] Emergency troubleshooting plan reviewed
- [ ] Post-launch debrief scheduled

**Mental Preparation**:
- [ ] Realistic expectations set (not every launch goes viral)
- [ ] Commitment to engagement (responding is more important than posting)

### ✅ Launch Day Reminders

- **Respond to EVERY comment** (within 15 minutes in first 6 hours)
- **Be humble and authentic** (not defensive or salesy)
- **Accept criticism gracefully** (it's feedback, not attack)
- **Show, don't just tell** (link to examples, invite to try)
- **Track everything** (you'll want this data for post-mortem)
- **Stay engaged all day** (first 6 hours are critical)
- **Celebrate small wins** (every genuine interest is a win)
- **Don't panic if slow start** (some great products had quiet launches)

### ✅ Post-Launch (Week 1)

- [ ] Day 1 metrics review: What worked? What didn't?
- [ ] Implement quick feedback fixes
- [ ] Thank all supporters publicly
- [ ] Continue engagement on launch platforms
- [ ] Expand to Tier 2 platforms (Discord, Facebook, forums)
- [ ] Personal outreach to highly engaged users
- [ ] Monitor retention of launch day signups
- [ ] Adjust Week 2 strategy based on learnings
