## DESCRIPTION (Compelling, 3-4 sentences)

### Version 1 (Problem-focused):
```
Tired of philosophical discussions being determined by who has more followers? ARGUED is where arguments are judged on actual merit—logic, evidence, and rhetoric—using Gemini AI. Submit your argument, get detailed feedback, earn reputation for quality reasoning. Built for anyone who wants thoughtful discourse without the noise.
```

### Version 2 (Feature-focused):
```
ARGUED brings fair judgment to philosophical debates. Two people argue a topic, Gemini AI scores each argument on logic, evidence, and rhetoric, and the winner earns reputation points. Every judgment includes detailed feedback so you can improve your reasoning. From casual questions to deep debates, all levels welcome.
```

### Version 3 (Vision-focused):
```
What if online arguments were judged on reasoning quality instead of popularity? ARGUED makes it happen. Our AI judges philosophical debates fairly, scoring logic, evidence, and rhetoric. No followers, no karma, no noise—just your best argument versus theirs. Join thinkers building a better discourse platform.
```

### Version 4 (Accessible):
```
Philosophy should be accessible, not intimidating. ARGUED is where anyone can debate philosophical topics and get fair AI feedback on their reasoning. Whether you're a curious beginner or a seasoned philosopher, you'll find structured debates, detailed feedback, and a community that values quality discourse over hot takes.
```

### Version 5 (Technical):
```
We built an AI-powered debate platform that judges arguments on merit, not virality. Using Gemini 2.5 Flash, we score philosophical debates across logic, evidence, and rhetoric—with detailed explanations for every judgment. Think debates that reward reasoning quality, not follower counts.
```

**RECOMMENDED:** Version 3 (strongest hook + clear value)

## FIRST COMMENT (Founder Story - Post immediately after launch)

### Maker's First Comment Template:

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], creator of ARGUED. So excited to share this with you.

**Why I built this:**

I love philosophy, but I kept running into the same problem: every platform optimizes for the wrong thing.

- Twitter: Philosophical discussions are determined by who has more followers, not who has better arguments
- Reddit: Good reasoning gets buried in noise and hot takes
- Academic spaces: Too formal and gatekeeping

I wanted a place where quality reasoning actually matters. Where a well-structured argument from a beginner can beat a weak argument from an expert. Where you get real feedback on your logic, not just upvotes.

**What makes ARGUED different:**

🤖 **AI Judgment**: Gemini 2.5 Flash scores arguments on logic, evidence, and rhetoric
📊 **Detailed Feedback**: Every judgment explains exactly why you got your score
🎯 **Fair Competition**: Your argument stands on its own merit, not your follower count
🏆 **Reputation System**: Win debates by reasoning well, not by being popular
📚 **All Levels Welcome**: Beginner-friendly but deep enough for experts

**How it works:**

1. Pick a philosophical topic (or create your own)
2. Join a debate as FOR or AGAINST
3. Submit your best argument
4. AI judges both arguments independently
5. Get scored, get feedback, earn reputation if you win

**Current stage:**

This is an early beta. Core features work well (debate creation, AI judgment, reputation), but lots more to build:

- More debate formats (multi-round, collaborative)
- Community features (reading groups, study partners)
- Better discovery (find debates that match your interests)
- Socratic dialogue mode (AI asks you questions to refine your thinking)

**What I need from you:**

- Try a debate and tell me if the AI judgment feels fair
- What features would make philosophical discourse better?
- How can we prevent gaming/abuse?
- Would you use this? Why or why not?

I'll be here all day answering questions and taking feedback. This community has been so helpful for my other projects—would love your thoughts on this one.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

[Your Name]
Founder, ARGUED

## HUNTER OUTREACH MESSAGE

If you want someone with a larger PH following to "hunt" your product:

### Template 1 (Direct):
```
Subject: Would you hunt ARGUED on Product Hunt?

Hey [Hunter Name],

I've been following your PH activity and love the products you've hunted (especially [specific product they hunted]).

I'm launching ARGUED—an AI-judged philosophical debate platform—and I think it would resonate with the PH community.

**Quick pitch:** It solves a real problem (online philosophy discussions are determined by popularity, not reasoning quality) with AI that judges arguments on logic, evidence, and rhetoric.

**Why I think you'd like it:**
- [Reason specific to their interests]
- It's technical and novel (Gemini 2.5 Flash for fair judgment)
- Aligns with [their values/interests]

Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to provide early access, answer questions, or just chat about the concept.

No pressure either way—I know you're selective!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 2 (Relationship-first):
```
Subject: Feedback request: AI-judged debate platform

Hey [Hunter Name],

Big fan of your work—I've learned a lot from your approach to [something specific].

I built something I think you'd find interesting: a platform where AI judges philosophical debates on merit instead of popularity. Think "Reddit for philosophy, but arguments are scored on logic/evidence/rhetoric."

Before launching on PH, I'd love your quick feedback:
- Does the concept resonate?
- Any red flags I should address?
- Would this interest the PH community?

I'd be honored if you wanted to hunt it, but honestly just getting your thoughts would be valuable.

Link: [beta link]

Thanks for considering!
[Your Name]
```

## COMMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When someone asks "How is this different from [competitor]?"
```
Great question! [Competitor] is excellent for [their strength].

What we do differently:
- AI judgment on reasoning quality (not just popularity)
- Structured debate format (not free-form discussion)
- Focus on learning and feedback (not just winning)

We see [competitor] as complementary—different tools for different needs. If you want [their value], use them. If you want [our value], try us.
```

### When someone asks about AI fairness:
```
Fairness is our biggest challenge and focus.

Our approach:
- Three separate scores (logic, evidence, rhetoric) to reduce bias
- Detailed written feedback so you can see the AI's reasoning
- Temperature settings tuned for consistency
- Planning appeals and human review for edge cases

We've tested ~50 debates and consistency is strong, but we're always improving. If you try it and the judgment feels unfair, please let me know exactly why—that feedback is gold.
```

### When someone suggests a feature:
```
Love this idea! [Acknowledge the value]

Quick question: How would you use this in practice? Trying to prioritize features that solve real use cases vs. adding complexity.

[If it's a great idea:] Adding this to the roadmap—would you be interested in beta testing when we build it?
```

### When someone is skeptical:
```
Totally fair skepticism! [Acknowledge their concern]

[Address it directly and honestly]

The best way to evaluate it is to try it—would love to hear your experience. If it doesn't work for you, I want to know why.
```

### When someone compliments the product:
```
Thank you! 🙏

What specifically stood out to you? Trying to understand what resonates so I can double down on it.

[If they're a user:] Would love to hear your feedback after trying it!
```

### When someone points out a bug/issue:
```
Oof, good catch. That's definitely a bug.

[Explain the issue if you understand it]

I'll fix this today and update you here. Thanks for flagging—this is exactly the kind of feedback I need.

[Later:] ✅ Fixed! Thanks again for catching this.
```

### When someone asks about pricing:
```
Currently free while in beta. We're focused on getting the product right before thinking about monetization.

Long-term, the plan is:
- Free tier: [what's included]
- Premium: [what's extra]

But that's months away. Right now, just want people to use it and tell me if it's valuable.
```
