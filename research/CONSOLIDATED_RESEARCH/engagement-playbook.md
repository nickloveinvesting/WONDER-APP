# ARGUED Engagement Playbook
## How to Engage Authentically and Convert Interest to Community

---

## Core Engagement Philosophy

**Principle**: Every comment is an opportunity to build relationship, not just defend product.

**Goals**:
1. Convert curious visitors to engaged users
2. Build trust through authentic, thoughtful responses
3. Create advocates who spread word organically
4. Learn from feedback (positive and negative)
5. Establish community culture from day one

**Not Goals**:
- Win every argument
- Defend every criticism
- Convert every visitor
- Please everyone

---

## Response Time Targets

### Launch Day (Critical)
**Platform**: All
**Response Time**: 5-15 minutes
**Rationale**: Algorithm boost, shows you care, builds momentum
**Energy Level**: Maximum - this is a sprint

### Week 1 (High Priority)
**Platform**: Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit
**Response Time**: 30 minutes - 1 hour
**Rationale**: Still in critical visibility window
**Energy Level**: High - sustained effort

### Week 2-4 (Standard)
**Platform**: All
**Response Time**: 1-3 hours (same day)
**Rationale**: Building relationships, less algorithm dependency
**Energy Level**: Medium - marathon pace

### Month 2+ (Sustainable)
**Platform**: All
**Response Time**: Same day (2-4 hours)
**Rationale**: Sustainable long-term engagement
**Energy Level**: Sustainable pace

### Special Cases
**Influencer/Press**: Within 30 minutes, any time
**Bug Report**: Immediately
**Angry User**: Within 1 hour
**Praise**: Within 30 minutes (reinforce positive)

## Comment Response Strategy by Platform

### Product Hunt

#### Types of Comments You'll Get

**1. Genuine Questions**
Example: *"How is this different from Reddit?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Great question! The key differences are:

1. Structure: Arguments are threaded with explicit claim→evidence→reasoning
2. Incentives: We reward "changed my mind" over viral dunks
3. Culture: Optimized for learning, not winning

Happy to elaborate on any of these if you want to go deeper!
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Acknowledges question
- ✅ Specific, not vague
- ✅ Lists for scanability
- ✅ Invites continued conversation
- ✅ Helpful, not salesy

**2. Skepticism/Criticism**
Example: *"This will just become another echo chamber like everything else."*

**Your Response Template**:
```
You're right to be skeptical - that's the pattern we've seen repeatedly.

Here's what we're doing differently (and what we're still figuring out):

✅ Actively rewarding changed minds
✅ Surfacing minority viewpoints
⚠️ Still experimenting with moderation balance

The honest answer: we don't know if we'll succeed, but we think the attempt
is worth making. Our beta has been promising so far.

What do you think would prevent echo chambers?
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Validates concern
- ✅ Honest about uncertainty
- ✅ Shows what you're trying
- ✅ Not defensive
- ✅ Asks for input (engagement)

**3. Feature Requests**
Example: *"Does it have a mobile app?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Not yet - we're web-first for now to iterate quickly.

Mobile app is high on the roadmap though. Would you use it primarily on
mobile? Curious what your use case would be.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Direct answer
- ✅ Explains why not (reasonable)
- ✅ Shows it's planned
- ✅ Asks qualifying question

**4. Competitive Comparison**
Example: *"How is this different from Kialo?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Good comparison! Kialo is excellent for structured debates.

Key differences in ARGUED:
- More free-form (less structured tree)
- Focus on philosophical discourse specifically
- "Changed my mind" > pro/con voting
- Community-driven topics vs single debates

Honestly, both can coexist - they serve slightly different needs. Have you
used Kialo? What do you like/not like about it?
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Acknowledges competitor positively
- ✅ Clear differentiation
- ✅ Not dismissive
- ✅ Asks about their experience

**5. Praise**
Example: *"This is exactly what the internet needs!"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Thank you! 🙏

We've been blown away by the quality of discussions in our beta. If you end
up trying it, I'd love to hear what you think.

What kind of topics would you want to discuss on a platform like this?
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Genuine gratitude
- ✅ Social proof (beta worked well)
- ✅ Soft call to action
- ✅ Continues engagement

**6. Trolls/Bad Faith**
Example: *"This is stupid and will never work."*

**Your Response**:
```
[Don't engage deeply]

I appreciate the feedback! If you try it and have specific suggestions,
I'm all ears.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Gracious but brief
- ✅ Doesn't take bait
- ✅ Leaves door open
- ✅ Doesn't look defensive to others

---

### Hacker News

#### HN-Specific Tone Requirements
- More technical
- More humble
- More detailed
- Acknowledge tradeoffs
- Discuss implementation honestly
- Don't be salesy AT ALL

#### Types of Comments You'll Get

**1. Technical Questions**
Example: *"What's your tech stack? How does the threading work?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Stack: Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL for data, deployed on Vercel.

Threading is interesting - we use a modified tree structure where each node
can have multiple "responses" but also "rebuttals" and "concessions." This
lets us track when someone changes their mind more explicitly than just
upvotes.

The challenge has been keeping the UX simple while allowing this complexity.
Still iterating on the right balance.

Happy to dive deeper on any specific aspect!
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Detailed technical answer
- ✅ Explains interesting decision
- ✅ Acknowledges challenge
- ✅ Shows iteration mindset
- ✅ Invites deeper discussion

**2. Skepticism (Common on HN)**
Example: *"The problem isn't the platform, it's people. You can't solve that with software."*

**Your Response Template**:
```
You're absolutely right that you can't solve human nature with code.

What we can do is shape incentives. Reddit's karma system rewards hivemind.
Twitter's retweets reward dunks. We're experimenting with rewarding
"changed my mind."

Will it work? Honestly, don't know. Our beta has been promising (N=100, so
grain of salt). But you're right that the core challenge is cultural, not
technical.

I'm curious: do you think platforms have ANY influence on discourse quality,
or is it entirely about the people?
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Agrees with main point
- ✅ Explains what IS possible
- ✅ Humble about outcomes
- ✅ Acknowledges limitations
- ✅ Engages philosophically (HN loves this)

**3. "This Has Been Tried Before"**
Example: *"This is just like [failed project X]. Why will this be different?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Fair point - [Project X] attempted something similar and struggled with
[specific reason].

Where we differ:
1. [Specific difference]
2. [Specific difference]
3. [Specific difference]

But you're right to be skeptical. Maybe we'll fail for the same reasons.
Maybe we'll fail for new reasons. :)

What do you think was the core issue with [Project X]? I've studied it but
would love your take.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Shows you know the history
- ✅ Specific differentiation
- ✅ Humble about risk
- ✅ Uses failure as learning opportunity
- ✅ HN appreciates thoughtful failure analysis

**4. Architecture/Scaling Questions**
Example: *"How will you moderate at scale?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Great question - and honestly, we're still figuring this out.

Current approach:
- Community flagging
- Karma threshold for certain actions
- Topic-specific moderators (like subreddit mods)
- AI assistance for detection (not decisions)

What we're worried about:
- Over-moderation killing nuance
- Under-moderation allowing bad actors
- Mod burnout

At N=100 users, we can do a lot manually. At N=10,000, we'll need better
systems. We're trying to build culture early while we can still do hands-on.

Have you moderated communities? Would love to learn from your experience.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Honest about uncertainty
- ✅ Shows current thinking
- ✅ Acknowledges real challenges
- ✅ Stage-appropriate (not over-engineering)
- ✅ Asks for wisdom from community

**5. Business Model Questions**
Example: *"How will you make money without ruining this?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
The eternal question. :)

Short term: We're not worried about monetization. Focus is on building
something valuable.

Long term ideas (all optional, none decided):
- Premium features (advanced analytics, custom themes)
- University/institution licenses
- Tips/patronage model

What we won't do:
- Surveillance advertising
- Selling data
- Pay-to-win mechanics

But you're right that monetization often ruins communities. Would rather
stay small and good than grow large and bad. We'll see if that's sustainable.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Transparent about plans
- ✅ Clear about values
- ✅ Realistic about tensions
- ✅ Willing to stay small (HN respects this)

---

### Reddit

#### Reddit-Specific Tone
- Casual but substantive
- Self-deprecating humor okay
- Engage with community norms
- Don't be corporate
- Show you're a real person

#### Types of Comments You'll Get

**1. "This Is Just an Ad"**
Example: *"Stop spamming your product."*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Fair feedback - I am promoting something I built, definitely.

I tried to add value by sharing [lessons learned / data / insights] rather
than just dropping a link. What would make this more valuable for the
community?

Genuinely asking - I want to contribute, not just extract attention.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Acknowledges the criticism
- ✅ Shows you tried to add value
- ✅ Asks how to do better
- ✅ Genuine, not defensive

**2. Reddit Meta-Criticism**
Example: *"So it's like Reddit but you think you're better than Reddit?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
Haha, I mean... I'm posting on Reddit, so I don't hate it.

ARGUED is more like "Reddit for people who want deep dives on specific
philosophical questions" vs Reddit's broad everything-ness.

Different tools for different needs. I love Reddit for [specific thing].
ARGUED is for when I want [different specific thing].

Not better, just different focus.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Humor defuses tension
- ✅ Doesn't trash Reddit
- ✅ Clear differentiation
- ✅ Acknowledges both have value

**3. Specific Feature Questions**
Example: *"Can I use markdown? Does it have dark mode?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
- Markdown: Yes!
- Dark mode: Not yet (I know, I know)
- [Other feature]: [Status]

What other features are must-haves for you?
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Quick, scannable answers
- ✅ Acknowledges gaps with humor
- ✅ Asks for more input

**4. Domain Expertise**
Example (on r/philosophy): *"Have you read Habermas on discourse ethics?"*

**Your Response Template**:
```
I have (though it's been a few years - TCA, right?). The ideal speech
situation was definitely an influence on thinking about platform design.

Are you thinking about how that maps to online discourse? I'd love to hear
your take - especially on where ideal speech situation breaks down in
practice online.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Shows you know the reference
- ✅ Humble about expertise
- ✅ Connects to project
- ✅ Invites expert to contribute
- ✅ Reddit loves expert discussions

## How to Handle Common Objections

### Objection 1: "This Will Never Scale"

**Weak Response**:
"Yes it will! We have great plans for scaling!"

**Strong Response**:
```
You might be right. Lots of quality-focused communities struggle at scale.

We're optimizing for quality over growth. If we stay at 10,000 deeply engaged
users instead of 10M passive ones, that's okay with us.

That said, we think some things scale: good incentives, clear culture,
distributed moderation. Time will tell.

What do you think are the hardest parts of scaling discourse quality?
```

**Why Better**:
- Acknowledges real concern
- Reframes success (quality > quantity)
- Shows thoughtful approach
- Learns from objection

### Objection 2: "I Don't Have Time for Long Debates"

**Weak Response**:
"It doesn't take that long!"

**Strong Response**:
```
Totally fair - not everyone wants to spend hours on a single debate thread.

ARGUED is definitely optimized for depth over speed. If you prefer quick
back-and-forth, Twitter or Reddit might be better fits.

We're building for people who enjoy the occasional deep dive. Like how some
people love 3-hour podcast episodes even if they don't always have time.

Not for everyone, and that's okay!
```

**Why Better**:
- Validates concern
- Clear about who it's for
- Okay with not being for everyone
- Good analogy

### Objection 3: "People Don't Change Their Minds"

**Weak Response**:
"Yes they do! It happens all the time!"

**Strong Response**:
```
In public, rarely. You're right.

But in our beta, we've seen it more than I expected. Not every debate, but
enough to be interesting.

Hypothesis: People change minds more when:
1. They're not performing for an audience
2. Changing mind is rewarded, not mocked
3. Structure forces engaging with strongest counterarguments

Still early, might be wrong. But the beta has been surprisingly promising.

Have you ever changed your mind in an online discussion? What made that
possible?
```

**Why Better**:
- Agrees with observation
- Shares real data
- Explains hypothesis
- Humble about outcomes
- Invites their experience

### Objection 4: "Just Use [Competitor X]"

**Weak Response**:
"No, ours is better because..."

**Strong Response**:
```
[Competitor X] is great for [what they do well]!

ARGUED is different in [specific way]. Whether that's "better" depends on
what you're looking for.

If you want [use case], definitely use [Competitor X].
If you want [our use case], ARGUED might be worth trying.

Have you used [Competitor X]? What do you like/not like about it?
```

**Why Better**:
- Respects competitor
- Clear differentiation
- Okay with not being universal solution
- Learns about user needs

### Objection 5: "This Is Impossible / Has Never Worked"

**Weak Response**:
"We're different! We'll make it work!"

**Strong Response**:
```
You're not wrong - history is littered with failed attempts at "better discourse."

We might fail too. Probably will, if we're being honest about base rates.

But we think it's worth trying because [reason]. And we're learning a lot
even if it doesn't work out.

What do you think was the core failure mode of previous attempts?
```

**Why Better**:
- Acknowledges history
- Realistic about odds
- Shows learning mindset
- Values attempt even if outcome uncertain
- Learns from skepticism

## When to Engage vs. When to Step Back

### ENGAGE When:
✅ Genuine questions
✅ Thoughtful criticism
✅ Feature requests
✅ Bug reports
✅ People sharing experiences
✅ First 24-48 hours of any post
✅ Influential people (politely)
✅ Expert domain knowledge shared

### STEP BACK When:
🛑 Conversation has run its course naturally
🛑 Community is discussing amongst themselves (don't interrupt)
🛑 Someone is clearly trolling/bad faith
🛑 You've already answered the same question 3+ times (link to previous answer)
🛑 You're getting defensive or emotional
🛑 It's 2am and you should be sleeping
🛑 The discussion has moved beyond your product (let it flow)

### NEVER Engage When:
❌ You're angry or frustrated
❌ It's clear bad faith / trolling
❌ Legal or PR risk (consult first)
❌ You'd just be arguing to "win"
❌ You don't have a good answer yet

## Converting Interest to Signups

### The Funnel
1. **Awareness**: They see your post
2. **Interest**: They read/comment
3. **Consideration**: They think about trying
4. **Action**: They sign up
5. **Activation**: They actually use it

### Strategies by Stage

#### Stage 1→2: Awareness to Interest
**Goal**: Make them want to learn more

**Tactics**:
- Compelling title/hook
- Interesting screenshot/example
- Curiosity gap ("How we got people to change minds...")
- Relatable problem statement

#### Stage 2→3: Interest to Consideration
**Goal**: Make them think "This could be for me"

**Tactics**:
- Show, don't tell (link to actual good debates)
- Use cases they can imagine themselves in
- Reduce perceived risk ("Free, no signup needed to browse")
- Social proof ("Our beta testers said...")

#### Stage 3→4: Consideration to Action
**Goal**: Remove friction to trying

**Tactics**:
- Clear call to action (but not pushy)
- Low commitment ("Check it out" not "Sign up today!")
- Make signup easy (email only, no credit card)
- Provide direct link in convenient place

#### Stage 4→5: Action to Activation
**Goal**: Get them to first value moment

**Tactics**:
- Great onboarding
- Highlight active debates
- Suggest relevant topics
- Personal welcome (if small enough)
- Quick win (easy first action)

### Example Conversion Flow

**Comment Thread**:
```
User: "This sounds interesting but I'm not sure I understand how it's different."

You: "Totally fair! The easiest way to see the difference is probably to look
at an actual debate. Here's one about AI consciousness that's been really
interesting: [link to specific debate]

You can browse without signing up - just check out how the arguments thread
and how people mark which ones made them reconsider.

Let me know what you think!"
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Validates confusion
- ✅ Shows rather than tells
- ✅ Specific example (not generic)
- ✅ No pressure (can browse)
- ✅ Invites feedback
- ✅ Natural call to action

---

## First 100 Users Strategy

### The Gold Rush: First 100 Are Most Important

**Why First 100 Matter**:
- Set culture and norms
- Create initial content
- Become advocates
- Provide feedback
- Define what "success" looks like

**Who You Want in First 100**:
- ✅ Thoughtful, good-faith arguers
- ✅ Diverse viewpoints (not echo chamber)
- ✅ Active participants (not lurkers)
- ✅ Tolerant of bugs/rough edges
- ✅ Willing to give feedback
- ✅ Potential advocates

**Who You DON'T Want in First 100**:
- ❌ Pure trolls
- ❌ Bad faith actors
- ❌ Rigid ideologues (can't change mind)
- ❌ People who need polished product
- ❌ Pure lurkers (fine later, not now)

### Personal Touch at Small Scale

**When You Have < 100 Users**:
- Personal welcome message to every signup
- Respond to every post/comment
- Ask for feedback directly
- Thank people for participating
- Remember usernames/contributions
- Make them feel special (because they are)

**Template Welcome Message**:
```
Hey [name]! Thanks for signing up for ARGUED.

We're still small (about 50 users right now), so I wanted to personally
welcome you and say:

1. Please be gentle - we're in beta and things will be rough
2. Your feedback is incredibly valuable at this stage
3. If you get stuck or confused, just email me directly: [email]

What topics are you interested in debating? I can point you to active
discussions or help you start one.

- [Your name]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Personal connection
- Sets expectations (beta = rough)
- Clear how to get help
- Asks about interests
- Makes them feel valuable

### Nurturing Power Users

**Identify Power Users Early**:
- Most active participants
- Highest quality contributions
- Most "changed my mind" awards
- Best at engaging others
- Culture carriers

**How to Nurture**:
- Personal thank you
- Ask for feedback on features
- Give them early access to new features
- Highlight their contributions
- Make them feel like partners, not users
- Consider moderator/ambassador roles

**Template Power User Outreach**:
```
Hey [name],

I've noticed you've been super active on ARGUED and your debates on [topic]
have been consistently thoughtful and engaging.

As we grow, we're thinking about creating a sort of "founding member" group
of people who help shape the culture and moderate discussions.

Would you be interested in being part of that? No obligations, just giving
you first access to new features and asking your input on big decisions.

Either way, thanks for being such a great member of the community!

- [Your name]
```

---

## Community Management Approach

### Culture Setting (Critical in Early Days)

**What You Reward Gets Repeated**:
- ✅ Highlighting great debates
- ✅ Celebrating changed minds
- ✅ Praising civil disagreement
- ✅ Showcasing steel-manning
- ✅ Rewarding nuance

**What You Tolerate Becomes Normal**:
- 🚫 Jump on bad behavior early
- 🚫 Don't let trolls set tone
- 🚫 Remove obviously bad faith actors
- 🚫 Enforce norms consistently
- 🚫 Address violations publicly (if appropriate)

### Moderation Philosophy

**Light Touch Early, Clear Boundaries**:
- Start permissive
- Be very clear about what crosses line
- Consistent enforcement
- Transparent about decisions
- Willing to admit mistakes

**What Gets Removed**:
- Personal attacks
- Clear bad faith
- Spam
- Illegal content
- Harassment

**What Doesn't Get Removed (Even If Controversial)**:
- Unpopular opinions
- Controversial topics
- Passionate disagreement
- Heated but civil debate
- Minority viewpoints

### Example Moderation Message:
```
Hey folks, removing [comment] because it crossed into personal attacks.

Critiquing arguments = good
Critiquing the person = not allowed

Let's keep it about ideas, not individuals. Thanks!
```

---

## Engagement Metrics to Track

### Quantitative
- Response time (average)
- Response rate (% of comments answered)
- Sentiment by platform
- Conversion: comment → signup
- Conversion: signup → active user
- Time spent per session
- Return rate

### Qualitative
- Tone of feedback (positive/neutral/negative)
- Depth of criticism (surface vs substantive)
- Quality of questions
- Expert engagement
- Community self-organizing

### Red Flags
- 🚩 Increasing negative sentiment
- 🚩 Same criticisms repeatedly
- 🚩 Users signing up but not activating
- 🚩 High churn after first session
- 🚩 Community becoming toxic
- 🚩 You're burning out on engagement

---

## Pre-Written Response Templates

### Template 1: Feature Not Available
```
Great suggestion! We don't have [feature] yet, but it's on the roadmap.

In the meantime, you can [workaround if available].

Would you use this feature daily, or more occasionally? Helps us prioritize.
```

### Template 2: Bug Report
```
Thanks for reporting this! That definitely shouldn't happen.

Can you give me a bit more detail:
- What browser/device?
- What were you trying to do?
- Can you reproduce it?

Email me at [email] if easier. Appreciate you helping us improve!
```

### Template 3: "This Won't Work"
```
You might be right! Lots of things are hard about building quality discourse
platforms.

We're learning as we go. What do you think is the biggest obstacle?
```

### Template 4: Generic Praise
```
Thank you! 🙏

If you end up trying it, I'd love to hear what you think - especially what
could be better.
```

### Template 5: "How Is This Different From X?"
```
Good question! Main differences:
1. [Difference 1]
2. [Difference 2]
3. [Difference 3]

Both have value - depends what you're looking for. Have you used [X]?
```

### Template 6: Thoughtful Criticism
```
This is really helpful feedback. You're right that [acknowledge their point].

We're still figuring out [the challenge]. Current thinking is [approach], but
your point about [their concern] is making me rethink that.

Do you have thoughts on how to balance [tradeoff]?
```

---

## Energy Management

### Launch Week Is Exhausting
- **Accept this**: You'll be tired
- **Plan for it**: Clear calendar
- **Eat and sleep**: Can't engage well if burned out
- **Take breaks**: Even 15 minutes helps
- **Have backup**: Can someone cover for an hour?

### Sustainable Pace
- **Week 1**: Sprint
- **Week 2**: Fast jog
- **Week 3**: Steady pace
- **Week 4+**: Marathon pace

### Signs You're Burning Out
- 🚩 Dreading opening comments
- 🚩 Getting defensive easily
- 🚩 Copy-pasting generic responses
- 🚩 Ignoring comments
- 🚩 Resentful of users

**If Burning Out**:
1. Take a day off
2. Reduce response time targets
3. Get help (co-founder, beta user, hire someone)
4. Remember why you're building this
5. Talk to happy users for energy boost

---

## The Meta-Game: Building Advocates

### Goal: Users Who Promote For You

**What Creates Advocates**:
- ✅ Great product experience
- ✅ Feeling heard (you responded!)
- ✅ Emotional connection
- ✅ Sense of ownership ("I helped shape this")
- ✅ Status (early user, power user)
- ✅ Shared values

**How to Encourage Advocacy**:
- Make it easy to share (good debates are shareable)
- Ask explicitly ("If you like it, share with friends who'd appreciate it")
- Recognize advocates publicly
- Give them early access
- Thank them personally

**Don't**:
- ❌ Beg for shares
- ❌ Incentivize with money (feels cheap)
- ❌ Auto-tweet from their account
- ❌ Make them feel used

### Example Advocate Ask:
```
Hey [name],

I noticed you've been really active and seem to be enjoying ARGUED.

If you know anyone else who loves deep philosophical discussions, I'd love if
you'd invite them. No pressure, just thought I'd mention it.

Here's a personal invite link: [link]

Thanks for being part of the early community!
```

---

## Final Principles

1. **Be Human**: People connect with people, not brands
2. **Be Honest**: Admit what you don't know, what's not working
3. **Be Grateful**: Every comment is someone's time and attention
4. **Be Curious**: Learn from every interaction
5. **Be Patient**: Community builds slowly
6. **Be Selective**: Quality > quantity in everything
7. **Be Consistent**: Show up, respond, engage, repeat

**Remember**: You're not just promoting a product. You're building a community. Every interaction is a brick in that foundation.

---

*The best engagement is authentic conversation. If you find yourself copy-pasting responses or dreading comments, something's wrong. Recalibrate.*
