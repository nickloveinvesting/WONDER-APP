## Red Flags & Services to Avoid

### Avoid These Scenarios

#### 🚩 Too-Good-to-Be-True Pricing
**Red Flag:** "Complete iOS app + design + submission + ASO for $100"

**Why It's Bad:**
- Impossible at that price
- Likely plagiarized work
- Will disappear after payment
- Might use stolen code

**Realistic Minimum:** $1,000 for quality full deployment

---

#### 🚩 Guaranteed App Store Rankings
**Red Flag:** "We guarantee #1 ranking for your keywords"

**Why It's Bad:**
- No one can guarantee rankings
- App Store algorithm is complex
- Rankings depend on downloads, reviews, engagement

**Realistic:** "We'll optimize your metadata and keywords"

---

#### 🚩 "We Don't Need Source Code"
**Red Flag:** Developer claims they can deploy without repo access

**Why It's Bad:**
- Need source to set up Capacitor properly
- Can't test thoroughly
- Red flag for template/cookie-cutter approach

**Legitimate:** Developer needs full repo access for Capacitor setup

---

#### 🚩 Refusing to Show Portfolio
**Red Flag:** "All my work is under NDA, can't show anything"

**Why It's Bad:**
- Everyone can show SOMETHING
- Easy to provide App Store links (apps are public)
- Likely inexperienced or lying

**Legitimate:** Can show most work, maybe one project under NDA

---

#### 🚩 Pressure to Move Off-Platform
**Red Flag:** "Let's communicate on WhatsApp/pay via PayPal for discount"

**Why It's Bad:**
- Violates platform rules
- No payment protection
- No dispute resolution
- Often a scam

**Never:** Pay outside platform until project complete

---

#### 🚩 Unrealistic Timeline
**Red Flag:** "I'll have your complex app on the App Store in 2 days"

**Why It's Bad:**
- Quality work takes time
- Rushing leads to bugs
- App Store review alone takes 24-48 hours
- Likely cutting corners

**Realistic Timeline:**
- Capacitor setup: 3-7 days
- Full deployment: 1-3 weeks
- App Store approval: 1-3 days after submission

---

### Specific Services to Avoid

#### Avoid: Generic App Builders (Not Specialized)
**Examples:** Outdated platforms, builders focused only on Android

**Why:** iOS has specific requirements, need iOS-specialized service

**Use Instead:** AppInstitute, GoodBarber, or custom development

---

#### Avoid: Cheap "Convert Any Website" Services
**Red Flag:** "$50 to convert any website to iOS app"

**Why:**
- Low quality WebView wrapper
- Poor user experience
- Often violates App Store guidelines
- May get rejected

**Use Instead:** Proper Capacitor setup ($600-1,500)

---

#### Avoid: Black-Hat ASO Services
**Red Flag:** "We'll get you 1,000 5-star reviews" or "Guaranteed downloads"

**Why:**
- Violates App Store guidelines
- Risk of app removal
- Fake reviews are detectable
- Damage to reputation

**Use Instead:** Organic ASO with legitimate services

---
