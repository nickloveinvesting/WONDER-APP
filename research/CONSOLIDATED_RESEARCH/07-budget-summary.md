2. **Content Creation** - Founder voice is authentic, builds trust
3. **Community Engagement** - Can't outsource, requires personal touch
4. **Feature Prioritization** - Strategic decisions only founder can make
5. **Launch Messaging** - Authenticity beats polish

### ⚠️ SHOULD OUTSOURCE (High ROI)
1. **iOS Capacitor Setup** ($700-800) - Specialized knowledge, saves 30-40 hours
2. **App Icon Design** ($75-150) - Professional polish, saves 8-12 hours
3. **As-Needed iOS Support** ($200-500/year) - Bug fixes, updates, compatibility

### ❓ OPTIONAL OUTSOURCING
1. **App Store Screenshots** ($100-300) - Can DIY with Figma, outsource if budget allows
2. **Complex UI Components** ($500-1,000) - Only if blocked, Claude Code usually sufficient
3. **Legal Documents** ($200-500) - Generators work initially, lawyer review later

### ❌ DON'T OUTSOURCE
