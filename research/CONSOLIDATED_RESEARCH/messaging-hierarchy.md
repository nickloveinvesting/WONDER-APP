## MESSAGING DO'S AND DON'TS

### DO:

✅ **Lead with connection and spectrum** (primary differentiators)
✅ **Position debate as optional feature** (not core identity)
✅ **Use "conversation" language** more than "argument" language

✅ **Use inclusive language** ("everyone welcome", "all levels")
✅ **Proof point all claims** (don't just say it, show it)

---

### DON'T:

❌ **Don't lead with competition** (repels 80% of market)
❌ **Don't use war/combat metaphors** ("crush opponents", "destroy arguments")
❌ **Don't emphasize winning/losing** (creates zero-sum perception)
❌ **Don't hide debate features** (competitive users need to see them)
❌ **Don't be vague about quality** (prove rigor, don't just claim it)
❌ **Don't over-promise** ("world's best" claims without proof)
❌ **Don't use academic jargon** (unless defining it)
❌ **Don't say "for everyone" without proving it** (show the spectrum)

---

## MESSAGING ADAPTATIONS BY CHANNEL

### Website / Landing Page
- **Primary message prominence** (hero section)
- **Visual hierarchy** (spectrum shown in layout)
- **Proof points required** (skeptical audience)
- **Multiple CTAs** (different entry points for different users)

**Example**: Hero shows spectrum visually (casual forum → Socratic circle → formal debate) with "Choose your depth" messaging

---

### Social Media (Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok)
- **Pillar-based rotation** (each post emphasizes one pillar)
- **Personality allowed** (more informal than website)
- **User stories featured** (social proof)
- **Shareable insights** (philosophical quotes, dilemmas)

**Example**: "Shower thoughts to symposiums 🚿🏛️" (playful, memorable, clear spectrum)

---

### Email Marketing
- **Segmented messaging** (beginners vs experts get different copy)
- **Benefit-focused** (what's in it for me?)
- **Progressive education** (layer messages over time)
- **Strong CTAs** (guide to specific actions)

**Example**: Beginner email emphasizes "no degree required" + quick questions; Expert email emphasizes rigor + formal debates

---

### Paid Advertising

- **Specific benefits** (not vague promises)
- **Strong CTA** (low-friction next step)

**Example**: "Tired of toxic philosophy debates on Reddit? Rigorous thinking, civil discourse, fair evaluation. [Try Free]"

---

### PR / Media Outreach

- **Trend connection** (loneliness epidemic, intellectual community hunger)
