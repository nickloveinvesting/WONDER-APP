Subject: New Platform for Philosophical Discussions - ARGUED

Dear Justin,

I'm writing to introduce ARGUED, a new platform I've developed to
address challenges in online philosophical discourse, particularly:
- Hostile environments for beginners and non-academics
- Ephemeral discussions that disappear after 24 hours
- Lack of structure for deep, sustained philosophical conversation

ARGUED features:
- Persistent, threaded discussions
- AI-facilitated Socratic dialogue
- Reading groups for philosophical texts
- Argument mapping and visualization
- Beginner-friendly onboarding

Given Daily Nous's commitment to fostering philosophical community,
I thought this might interest your readers. Would you be open to
featuring ARGUED in your "Resources for Philosophers" section or
considering a post about it?

I'm happy to provide early access for the Daily Nous community and
would welcome any feedback.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Link to ARGUED]

philosophy communities succeed or fail. The article would explore:

- The future of digital philosophical communities

This would be of interest to Philosophy Now readers interested in
