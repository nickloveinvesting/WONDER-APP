2. **Social anxiety:** "Some lurkers are socially anxious about contributing, worrying if they're berated for asking something stupid"

4. **Preference:** Simply prefer reading over writing
5. **Time constraints:** Don't have time to engage deeply

**Lurker Value:**
- They ARE engaged, just passively
- Represent huge conversion opportunity
- Often become active with right triggers
- May engage on other platforms (our app!)

### Occasional Contributors (9%)
- Comment sometimes, rarely post
- Respond when they have specific expertise
- Seasonal engagement (students)
- Topic-specific participation

### Power Users (1%)
- Post and comment frequently
- Often moderators or academics
- Define community culture
