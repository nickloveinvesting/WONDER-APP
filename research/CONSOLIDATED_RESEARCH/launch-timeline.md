# ARGUED Launch Timeline
## Comprehensive Week-by-Week Launch Plan

---

## Overview

**Launch Strategy**: Phased approach with soft launch for quality control, followed by coordinated public launch for maximum impact, then sustained growth.

**Total Timeline**: 6 weeks (2 weeks soft launch + 4 weeks public launch and growth)

- [ ] Immediately post first comment (critical!):
  ```
  Hey HN! I'm [name], creator of ARGUED.

  I built this because I missed the old internet where people actually engaged
  with ideas instead of just dunking on each other. After watching my favorite
  Reddit communities descend into groupthink and Twitter become increasingly
  hostile, I wanted to create a space optimized for changing your mind, not
  just winning arguments.

  Technical details: [brief stack info if relevant]

  We've been in beta for 2 weeks with ~100 users and have had some genuinely
  great debates about [example topics].

  I'd love feedback from the HN community - especially around the voting
  mechanism and moderation approach. Happy to answer any questions!
  ```

## Ongoing (Month 2+): Product-Led Growth

- Week 4: Metrics and optimization

**Sustainable Activities:**

- Word-of-mouth referrals increasing
- Users inviting friends without prompting
- Search traffic growing
- Community self-moderating and self-organizing

---

## Key Principles Throughout

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better 100 engaged philosophers than 10,000 lurkers
2. **Authentic Over Promotional**: Share learnings, not just links
3. **Responsive Over Scheduled**: Engage genuinely with every comment
4. **Community Over Growth**: Build culture early, growth follows
5. **Patient Over Pushy**: This is a marathon, not a sprint

---

## Emergency Protocols

### If Product Hunt Launch Fails
- Don't panic
- Postpone HN launch by a day
- Analyze why (wrong day? poor description? bad timing?)
- Try again next Tuesday or pivot to HN-first strategy

### If HN Post Gets Flagged
- Reach out to mods politely
- Likely reason: too promotional or wrong format
- Revise and try again in 1 week with different angle
- Focus on Reddit and other channels in meantime

### If Reddit Bans You
- Don't post to more subreddits
- Review what went wrong (spam detection, rules violation?)
- Wait 1 week before trying again
- Focus on forums and other communities
- Build karma naturally before next attempt

### If Server Crashes During Launch
- Have backup deployment ready
- Apologize transparently on all platforms
- Use it as opportunity to show responsiveness
- Update with "We're back!" when fixed
- Builds authenticity and resilience narrative

### If No One Cares
- This is most likely on some platforms, don't be discouraged
- Double down on channels that ARE working
- Talk to users to understand what resonates
- Iterate messaging and positioning
- Remember: slow and steady wins the race for quality community
