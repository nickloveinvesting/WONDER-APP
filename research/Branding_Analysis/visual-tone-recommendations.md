---

## OPTION A: REFINED FORMALITY
### Keep Current, Optimize Execution

**Philosophy**: "The palette isn't the problem—how we use it is."

This option maintains navy/brown/cream but applies it differently to reduce formality and increase approachability.

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- **Navy** (#1A3A52) - Reduced usage, UI elements only
- **Cream** (#F5F3F0) - Primary background
- **Near-Black** (#1C1C1C) - Primary text

**Secondary Colors:**
- **Warm Gray** (#6B7280) - Replaces brown for less formal feel
- **Soft Blue** (#60A5FA) - Lighter navy alternative for less serious contexts

**Accent Colors:**
- **Sage Green** (#8FBC8F) - Replaces success green, more neutral
- **Warm Amber** (#F59E0B) - Replaces brown as warm accent
- **Soft Purple** (#A78BFA) - New: Questions and exploration

**Removed:**
- ❌ Brown (#8B6F47) - Too achievement-focused
- ❌ Gold (#D4A574) - Trophy mentality
- ❌ Success Green (#4A7C59) - Binary judgment
- ❌ Error Red (#C84C3C) - Punitive framing

### Application Strategy

**What Changes:**
1. **Navy becomes accent, not dominant**
   - Use: Navigation, important CTAs only
   - Don't use: Large background sections, headers

2. **Cream dominates**
   - 70% of viewport is cream or lighter
   - Creates airier, less heavy feel

3. **Warm accents added**
   - Sage for growth/reflection
   - Amber for warmth
   - Purple for questions
   - Create visual diversity

4. **Remove judgment colors**
   - No more "success" or "error"
   - Use neutral semantic colors
   - Information, not evaluation

### Visual Mockup Description

**Landing Page:**

**Debate View:**

**Dashboard:**
