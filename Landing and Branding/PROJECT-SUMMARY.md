## COPY FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

### Headlines Tested (A/B Ready)

**Primary:** "Where Philosophy Comes Alive"
- Aspirational, positive, inclusive
- Target: Broad appeal across all segments

**Alternatives:**
1. "Duel Minds, Not Egos" — Competitive, removes toxicity concerns
2. "Think. Debate. Evolve." — Action-oriented, growth-focused
3. "The Arena for Ideas" — Metaphorical, intellectual positioning
4. "Philosophy's New Home" — Community, belonging angle
5. "Beyond the Echo Chamber" — Problem-aware positioning

### Copy Framework: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Problem:** "Twitter is shallow. Philosophy forums are toxic or dead. No fair place for rigorous debate."

**Agitation:** "Your best ideas disappear. Good arguments buried. Serious thinkers can't find community."

**Solution:** "PhiloDuel: Fair AI judgment. Real community. Daily philosophy. Build reputation."

### Value Propositions (Tested)

1. **Fair AI Judgment** — "No more popularity contests"
2. **Daily Philosophy** — "Keep your mind sharp"
3. **Real Community** — "Find your philosophical tribe"
4. **Reputation Building** — "Intellectual credibility matters"
5. **Truth-First** — "Misinformation dies here"
