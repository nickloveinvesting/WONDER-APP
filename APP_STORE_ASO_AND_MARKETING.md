## PART 1: KEYWORD RESEARCH & ASO STRATEGY

### 1.1 Keyword Analysis Framework

**Three Dimensions to Consider:**

1. **Search Volume:** How many people search for this term monthly
2. **Competition:** How many apps already target this keyword
3. **Relevance:** How well does WONDER match the intent

**Scoring System (1-5):**
- Volume: 5 = 10K+/month, 1 = <1K/month
- Competition: 5 = Very high, 1 = Very low  
- Relevance: 5 = Perfect match, 1 = Poor match

### 2.2 App Description (4000 characters)

**WONDER App Store Description - FINAL**

```
WONDER is where curious minds come together to explore big ideas.

Challenge your thinking. Debate with strangers who see the world 
differently. Grow your perspective through rigorous philosophical dialogue.

=== THE CORE EXPERIENCE ===

Create a Philosophical Debate:
Propose any philosophical question: free will, consciousness, morality, 
existence, meaning. Others will join your debate, arguing for their position 
while you defend yours.

Submit Your Argument:
You have one chance to make your case. No word limits—just clarity and 
conviction. Cite sources, use logic, appeal to reason.

AI Judges Your Arguments:
Our AI analyzes both sides on three dimensions:
- Logic: Sound reasoning and valid structure
- Evidence: Quality and relevance of support
- Rhetoric: Clarity and persuasiveness

You get detailed feedback on where your argument excels and where you could 
strengthen your reasoning.

Discuss with Other Thinkers:
Upvote insightful points. Discuss alternatives. Shift perspectives. Some of 
the best philosophy happens after the formal debate ends.

Build Your Reputation:
Earn influence through thoughtful participation. See your growth with 
streak tracking and depth scoring. Climb the leaderboard.

=== WHAT MAKES WONDER DIFFERENT ===

✓ Philosophical focus (not politics or pop culture)
✓ AI-powered judgment (learn how to argue better)
