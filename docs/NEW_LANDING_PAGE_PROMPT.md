Copy this entire prompt into a NEW Claude conversation:

---

I need you to design a premium, high-converting landing page for ARGUED using the premium-landing-designer skill.

## PROJECT CONTEXT

**Product Name**: ARGUED
**Platform Type**: Philosophical discourse platform for intellectuals
**URL**: https://philosophy-app-eight.vercel.app (currently deployed)

## BRAND POSITIONING

ARGUED is positioned as **"Where Intellectuals Converge"** - a sophisticated platform for serious philosophical discourse, NOT a casual debate/gaming platform.

**Target Audience**: 
- Intellectuals, knowledge workers, educated professionals
- Philosophy enthusiasts who take ideas seriously
- People interested in ethics, AI ethics, consciousness, morality
- Premium positioning (sophisticated, not mass market)

**Tone**: 
- Intellectual but not elitist
- Serious but not stuffy
- Professional and modern
- Rigorous discourse for thoughtful minds

## WHAT MAKES ARGUED DIFFERENT

**NOT**: A competitive debate platform (like Chess.com for philosophy)
**IS**: A multi-format intellectual discourse platform

**Three Core Formats**:
1. **Discuss** (Conversational) - Topic-based discussions, no judgment, community-driven
2. **Inquire** (Exploratory) - Socratic circles, daily dilemmas, collaborative truth-seeking
3. **Debate** (Competitive) - Formal AI-judged arguments (this is ONE feature, not the primary one)

**Key Features**:
- AI-enhanced (Gemini AI facilitates discussions, suggests questions, connects ideas)
- Multiple engagement formats (from casual to formal)
- Quality standards (reputation-gated advanced discussions)
- Community organization by topics (Ethics, AI, Consciousness, Morality)

## COLOR PALETTE REQUIREMENTS

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS**:
- NO purple (absolutely forbidden)
- NO yellow (absolutely forbidden)
- Must feel professional, modern, sophisticated
- Should convey intellectual gravitas without being cold

**Suggested Direction** (you can propose alternatives):
- Charcoal/slate dark tones
- Teal or deep blue accents
- Warm neutrals (off-white, warm grays)
- Sophisticated, minimal palette

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

**Critical**: Use the premium-landing-designer skill to avoid AI-typical designs:
- NO gradient backgrounds (use solid colors)
- NO everything-centered layouts (use asymmetry)
- NO rainbow colors (monochrome + 1 accent max)
- NO stock photos (use product mockups or abstract shapes)
- NO 12+ features in a grid (max 3-6 strategic features)
- NO pill-shaped buttons (use subtle radius)
- NO generic copy ("unlock your potential", "next level", etc.)

**Must Include**:
- Asymmetric hero (60/40 split, not centered)
- Generous white space (80-128px section padding)
- 1-2 fonts maximum
- 18-20px body text (readable)
- Subtle shadows or borders (no heavy drop shadows)
- Specific, transformation-focused copy

## LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE

**Required Sections**:

1. **Hero**: 
   - Headline: "Where Intellectuals Converge"
   - Subheadline: Focus on rigorous discourse
   - Emphasize multiple formats (not just debates)
   - Primary CTA: "Begin Your Journey" or "Enter ARGUED"
   - Visual: Product screenshot or minimal abstract design

2. **Problem/Value Proposition**:
   - Address the gap in current philosophy platforms
   - Reddit = chaotic, Academia = gatekeeping, Forums = low quality
   - ARGUED = Serious discourse with multiple formats

3. **Three Formats** (Core Feature):
   - Discuss (💭 Conversational)
   - Inquire (🤔 Exploratory)  
   - Debate (⚔️ Competitive)
   - Make clear these are EQUAL options, not debate-primary

4. **AI-Enhanced Experience**:
   - Gemini AI as facilitator, not just judge
   - Helps discussions, suggests questions, connects ideas
   - Judgment is ONE use case of many

5. **Community & Topics**:
   - Ethics, AI Ethics, Consciousness, Morality
   - Multiple discussion formats
   - Quality standards without gatekeeping

6. **Social Proof** (if applicable):
   - "500+ active intellectuals"
   - "2.3K+ discussions"
   - "12+ topic communities"

7. **Final CTA**:
   - Restate value proposition
   - Clear call to action
   - Low friction (no credit card, free to start)

## TECHNICAL STACK

- Next.js 15 + React
- Tailwind CSS (use consistent 8pt spacing scale)
- Clean, semantic HTML
- Mobile-responsive
- Fast loading

## DELIVERABLES REQUESTED

1. Complete HTML landing page with Tailwind CSS
2. Modern, professional design that avoids AI clichés
3. Conversion-focused copy (specific, not generic)
4. Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
5. Clean code structure

## KEY MESSAGING TO AVOID

❌ "Unlock your potential"
❌ "Next level philosophy"
❌ "Revolutionize your thinking"
❌ Anything that sounds like generic AI copy

## KEY MESSAGING TO USE

✅ "Rigorous discourse for thoughtful minds"
✅ "Where intellectuals converge"
✅ Specific topics: ethics, AI, consciousness, morality
✅ Multiple formats from casual to formal
✅ Quality standards + accessibility

## INSPIRATION REFERENCES

Think of:
- **Substack** (intellectual, clean, content-focused)
- **Linear** (modern, sophisticated UI)
- **Notion** (professional, minimal, functional)

NOT:
- **Duolingo** (too gamified, too casual)
- **Reddit** (too chaotic)
- **Traditional forums** (too dated)

## FINAL NOTE

This is for a premium intellectual platform. The design should feel sophisticated, modern, and professional - like a place where serious thinkers want to spend time. Avoid anything that looks "gamified" or overly competitive. The debate feature is ONE option, not the identity of the platform.

Please use the premium-landing-designer skill and reference its anti-patterns guide to ensure this doesn't look AI-generated.
